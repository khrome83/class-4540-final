<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:40">3:40</a> I’ve never considered running Sass on the remote server &#8211; but is this the optimal way to go about it? Do people really process their Sass files on the remote server? What are the pros and cons of this workflow?</li>

<li><a href="#t=17:20">17:20</a> What is the best way of styling tooltips? Google doesn’t come up with much. Have things moved on at all since the last CSS Tricks article about it in 2011? It seems very complicated for a much needed and simple effect.</li>
<li><a href="#t=23:24">23:24</a> How do you guys seem to level up so quickly? I have been focused on learning JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP for a while now and, for whatever reason, I cannot get to that next level of understanding.</li>
<li><a href="#t=28:55">28:55</a> I work at a public library where we help put on an annual event that runs for a few months. Each year the event has a different theme. The site gets a few thousand visits during the course the event, so I’m weighing how much time/effort I should really put into this.</li>
<li><a href="#t=34:38">34:38</a> I have some JS running on a page every 300ms to do&#8230;stuff. I’m worried that it’s going to result in some kind of poor performance, but I’m not sure what to look for. <a href="http://scottfennell.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/10/screen.gif">Buffer Chrome Timeline</a></li>
<li><a href="#t=38:13">38:13</a> I’ve had a problem keeping the navigation in place when dealing with items with slightly different heights, I think this make for a better UX do you have any advice on keeping the pagination in place?</li>
<li><a href="#t=41:00">41:00</a> We use WordPress for all client sites and have pretty efficient gulp setup with sass compiling and concatenation. But as soon as you start to use a few wordpress plugins that all come with their own scripts and stylesheets the whole “Limited http requests” is out the window. Is there a way to get our theme to intercept the plugin scripts and stylesheets and combine them with my own and that way limit the amount of http requests?</li>
<li><a href="#t=43:19">43:19</a> We have a ton of legacy CSS. Is it worth the time to reverse engineer any of this to Sass? Are the CSS to Sass tools good at this? What is your experience modernizing legacy CSS?</li>
<li><a href="#t=50:48">50:48</a> How much of SEO do you take on, how much do you contract out?</li>
<li><a href="#t=58:50">58:50</a> How can I build a portfolio of websites that show that I’m a capable front-end dev when most job listings seem to have an endless list of requirements that I feel I’d never be able to encapsulate alone as one person?</li>

Q &#38; A

3:40 I’ve never considered running Sass on the remote server &#8211; but is this the optimal way to go about it? Do people really process their Sass files on the remote server? What are the pros and cons of this workflow?
12:20 I was interested in hearing more about Dave’s rsync workflow to deploy his site.
17:20 What is the best way of styling tooltips? Google doesn’t come up with much. Have things moved on at all since the last CSS Tricks article about it in 2011? It seems very complicated for a much needed and simple effect.
23:24 How do you guys seem to level up so quickly? I have been focused on learning JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP for a while now and, for whatever reason, I cannot get to that next level of understanding.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Rapidfire #52 includes questions about Jekyll, Team Foundation Server, server performance, design training, minimum touch size, cascade vs cascade, estimating projects and as usual &#8211; a whole lot more.</p>
<h3>Q &amp; A</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:11">3:11</a> What can I get with Jekyll that is more superior? Is it just the ability to able to write in markdown? </li>
<li><a href="#t=10:35">10:35</a> When Paravel worked on Microsoft.com were you using Team Foundation Server (TFS) for version control or Git? Since this is a Microsoft product I was wondering if they were using it. Also concerning #davegoeswindows, did you/are you moving from Git to TFS? If so how is it going with TFS?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Intro
Rapidfire #52 includes questions about Jekyll, Team Foundation Server, server performance, design training, minimum touch size, cascade vs cascade, estimating projects and as usual &#8211; a whole lot more.
Q &#38; A

3:11 What can I get with Jekyll that is more superior? Is it just the ability to able to write in markdown? 
10:35 When Paravel worked on Microsoft.com were you using Team Foundation Server (TFS) for version control or Git? Since this is a Microsoft product I was wondering if they were using it. Also concerning #davegoeswindows, did you/are you moving from Git to TFS? If so how is it going with TFS?
13:25 I understand performance basics like minimizing requests, gzip, and browser caching, but I’d like to learn more about how servers work because I feel like I’m missing out on a big part of the performance picture.
21:00 Are there specific courses geared towards web design that you guys would recommend? Or, do you know what a good starting point for an intermediate designer would be?
25:00 What minimum size do you find most comfortable for touch events?
30:40 What does the term “cascade” mean in regards to CSS? There seem to be two commonly used but different definitions. So which is it? Or is it both? Or does it even matter?
34:34 I have been learning a lot about keyboard accessibility lately and am trying to be more proactive in using this best practice. Any advice on controlling focus (specifically within dropdown menus or otherwise hidden elements)?
44:00 Is there a great place to go for learning how to master WordPress’ functions.php file? I feel like my template development would be a lot stronger/easier if I only understood what could go in that file.
50:32 Do we still need to create a site map for a site? I don’t think anyone typically used them except for circumstances where they can’t find what they’re looking for. Does Google need it?
53:17 I’ve landed the role of PM in a 3-man startup, and I was hoping you both could give some insights into what methods have worked for you when it comes to budget estimates, particularly as it pertains to time.

<li><a href="#t=9:53">9:53</a>  I have a question about managing your local WordPress setup. For awhile, I have used just one WordPress install and one database and then I switch to whatever theme I am working on at the time. Do you have separate installs and databases for each project?</li>

27:40 Dave, what are you doing about managing file paths in your applications? Have you run into any problems with Node dependencies choking on trying to find a file using ‘/‘ instead of ‘’?
32:40 I’m the lead developer at my small shop of 14 people so I’m always trying to come up with cool ways to make the team for efficient and bring everyone’s skill up. I recently was thinking about implementing coding style guides to help unify our code.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>This episode we talk with Saron Yitbarek, a developer currently working at Microsft who started CodeNewbie. We discuss podcasting techniques, work/life balance, experience vs training, and RSI treatment.</p>
<h3>Q &amp; A</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=23:12">23:12</a> How are you keeping your life balanced? What tools do you use to manage everything?</li>
<li><a href="#t=31:40">31:40</a> How well should you know JavaScript / JS Frameworks before you consider yourself a good front end developer? Also, at what point would you consider yourself a senior developer?</li>
<li><a href="#t=39:54">39:54</a> How can I get past the initial inexperience stigma? I am extremely talented straight out of college, yet it’s hard to get jobs because I have no experience.</li>
<li><a href="#t=52:13">52:13</a> Are there any legal ramifications for publishing a copy of another sites information online? Should I have an alert on the surge site that lets users know that this is a copy of somename.com?</li>
<li><a href="#t=54:38">54:38</a> I just wondered if you guys could offer any advice to people suffering from RSI or if you have had any personal experience with this (or any other type of) work based injury. </li>
<li><a href="#t=1:03:00">1:03:00</a> Is it worth relocating to pursue a career working with a specific technology now or would it be better to wait it out until more opportunities arise?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Intro
This episode we talk with Saron Yitbarek, a developer currently working at Microsft who started CodeNewbie. We discuss podcasting techniques, work/life balance, experience vs training, and RSI treatment.
Q &#38; A

23:12 How are you keeping your life balanced? What tools do you use to manage everything?
31:40 How well should you know JavaScript / JS Frameworks before you consider yourself a good front end developer? Also, at what point would you consider yourself a senior developer?
39:54 How can I get past the initial inexperience stigma? I am extremely talented straight out of college, yet it’s hard to get jobs because I have no experience.
52:13 Are there any legal ramifications for publishing a copy of another sites information online? Should I have an alert on the surge site that lets users know that this is a copy of somename.com?
54:38 I just wondered if you guys could offer any advice to people suffering from RSI or if you have had any personal experience with this (or any other type of) work based injury. 
1:03:00 Is it worth relocating to pursue a career working with a specific technology now or would it be better to wait it out until more opportunities arise?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve got another <strong>RAPIDFIRE</strong> for you this week! Pew Pew Pew, Kaboom!</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=2:30">2:30</a> At least twice a week, someone other than me will drop in a few lines of SCSS, compile it and we’ll end up merge-conflict town, adding a painful step in our branching process. How would you handle this? To date, my strategy has been to leave the room when anyone looks like they’re doing a merge conflict.</li>
<li><a href="#t=7:40">7:40</a> I have a website with HUNDREDS of raster images of around 15KB each. During interaction with a single page, it’s very likely that a user will need to see every one of those images. Is there a nice way of speeding up “above-the-fold” image loading other than this iterative AJAX call per page thing I’m doing? I’ve tried using compass’s sprite sheets, but the sprite file size is double that of all the images combined (maybe large color index table from disparate images?).</li>
<li><a href="#t=13:52">13:52</a> I have a brochure style site for my own business and I’ve been working on performance lately. I hooked up with grunt, started concatenating, moved my JS down and used uglification, and was ready to start separating out my above-the-fold css. It’s fun, but the optimization never ends… Then I ran into an article about <code>mod_pagespeed</code>. My hosting provider offers it and Google’s info basically says “hey optimization is tough, so let us take care of it.” So.. is <code>mod_pagespeed</code> a good idea?</li>
<li><a href="#t=21:20">21:20</a> Hey guys, I am an email developer and had a question about automation. Here is the situation, we send out several emails a week with each email containing anywhere from 25 to 70 links. We use a third party company to provide updated links to allow us to track which link is clicked. The problem is, they provide the links in an excel document, different from the brief where the original content came from. This forces me to replace each link manually, opening up large room for error and adding time to each project. Is this something Grunt or Gulp could help with?</li>
<li><a href="#t=27:10">27:10</a> A couple of factors to this question &#8211; 1) my company is moving to a new platform, so our URL structure is going to be changing once that goes live, and 2) we recently purchased a new (shorter, better) domain for our website. We are aware of the fact that you take an SEO hit when you do either of these things &#8211; so what do you think, is it better to make both of these changes at once and take one big hit, or change the domain now and update the URL structure later? We are going to be putting in 301 redirects regardless.</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:30">30:30</a> I was poking around Sara Soueidan’s code on her website and saw a bunch of stuff about DNS Prefetching. What the what?</li>
<li><a href="#t=37:55">37:55</a> I’ve been messing around with critical path CSS and getting content to my users as fast possible, which seems to mean accepting FOUT and other visual jankiness before all styles, scripts and images have loaded. It got me wondering, do I now have to choose between a site that loads super fast and a site that loads with fancy transitions and animations? Surely optimizing the critical path is all about removing anything that delays the arrival of content on the page.</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:30">44:30</a> Recently co presented on a talk about Front End Architecture at a good sized event, from the comments we DID get people wanted something much more direct, more answers. The talk was about what are the options available, and what guidelines we use to choose from them. I feel like that “well, it depends” is a recurring theme in a lot of the answers to the questions you get, because that’s the nature of the beast. Given that, and that you guys also have a lot of speaking experience… I’m curious what you guys think. Is that kind of ‘nuanced’ topic not good for ‘talks’ at events? Is that feedback from an audience inevitable and I should keep submitting talks until a cane pulls me off stage?</li>
<li><a href="#t=52:52">52:52</a> Should I get a mac?? I’ve been a windows user for 12+ years now and I just feel more comfortable using windows but I see all developer are using mac, all screencasts are on mac and a lot of the new apps are only available for mac <img src="http://stscdn.paravel.netdna-cdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> should I give up and switch to OS X?</li>

		<itunes:summary>We&#8217;ve got another RAPIDFIRE for you this week! Pew Pew Pew, Kaboom!
Q &#38; A:

2:30 At least twice a week, someone other than me will drop in a few lines of SCSS, compile it and we’ll end up merge-conflict town, adding a painful step in our branching process. How would you handle this? To date, my strategy has been to leave the room when anyone looks like they’re doing a merge conflict.
7:40 I have a website with HUNDREDS of raster images of around 15KB each. During interaction with a single page, it’s very likely that a user will need to see every one of those images. Is there a nice way of speeding up “above-the-fold” image loading other than this iterative AJAX call per page thing I’m doing? I’ve tried using compass’s sprite sheets, but the sprite file size is double that of all the images combined (maybe large color index table from disparate images?).
13:52 I have a brochure style site for my own business and I’ve been working on performance lately. I hooked up with grunt, started concatenating, moved my JS down and used uglification, and was ready to start separating out my above-the-fold css. It’s fun, but the optimization never ends… Then I ran into an article about mod_pagespeed. My hosting provider offers it and Google’s info basically says “hey optimization is tough, so let us take care of it.” So.. is mod_pagespeed a good idea?
21:20 Hey guys, I am an email developer and had a question about automation. Here is the situation, we send out several emails a week with each email containing anywhere from 25 to 70 links. We use a third party company to provide updated links to allow us to track which link is clicked. The problem is, they provide the links in an excel document, different from the brief where the original content came from. This forces me to replace each link manually, opening up large room for error and adding time to each project. Is this something Grunt or Gulp could help with?
27:10 A couple of factors to this question &#8211; 1) my company is moving to a new platform, so our URL structure is going to be changing once that goes live, and 2) we recently purchased a new (shorter, better) domain for our website. We are aware of the fact that you take an SEO hit when you do either of these things &#8211; so what do you think, is it better to make both of these changes at once and take one big hit, or change the domain now and update the URL structure later? We are going to be putting in 301 redirects regardless.
30:30 I was poking around Sara Soueidan’s code on her website and saw a bunch of stuff about DNS Prefetching. What the what?
37:55 I’ve been messing around with critical path CSS and getting content to my users as fast possible, which seems to mean accepting FOUT and other visual jankiness before all styles, scripts and images have loaded. It got me wondering, do I now have to choose between a site that loads super fast and a site that loads with fancy transitions and animations? Surely optimizing the critical path is all about removing anything that delays the arrival of content on the page.
44:30 Recently co presented on a talk about Front End Architecture at a good sized event, from the comments we DID get people wanted something much more direct, more answers. The talk was about what are the options available, and what guidelines we use to choose from them. I feel like that “well, it depends” is a recurring theme in a lot of the answers to the questions you get, because that’s the nature of the beast. Given that, and that you guys also have a lot of speaking experience… I’m curious what you guys think. Is that kind of ‘nuanced’ topic not good for ‘talks’ at events? Is that feedback from an audience inevitable and I should keep submitting talks until a cane pulls me off stage?
52:52 Should I get a mac?? I’ve been a windows user for 12+ years now and I just feel more comfortable using windows but I see all developer are using mac, all screencasts are on mac and a lot of the new apps a[...]</itunes:summary>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve got another RAPID-FIRE for you this week! Nothing but questions and answers. That&#8217;s what you like, right? Ohhhh, yeah.</p>
<p>We answer questions about fonts on Windows PCs, CSS frameworks, carousels, organizing SASS files, deploying with rsync, unicorns, managing Gulp files, and more!</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=2:27">2:27</a> After designing and creating a website on a Mac and getting everything looking pretty, I always get a bit disappointed when I come to look at the site on a PC. I find the font smoothing and colour management on OS X make everything look substantially nicer, particularly @font-face fonts. Adding a subtle text shadow to everything helps a bit but are there any plugins or other tools to improve font smoothing on the users’ screen? If not, is there anything you take care to avoid at the design stage to make the difference less apparent in the end product?</li>
<li><a href="#t=6:30">6:30</a> I&#8217;m used to building websites from scratch, but I&#8217;m getting into HTML5 frameworks. What is the best way to customize one of those frameworks?</li>
<li><a href="#t=11:55">11:55</a> How do you feel about condensing information into swiping carousel on mobile devices? Basically, if a site has 3 columns of informational text on desktop it will turn into a 1 column carousel with swiping functionality on mobile. Some of the designers like it because it provides more interactive/fun experience on mobile, as well as helping balance and shorten the page length. I feel like this has the same principle of regular hero sized carousels and the fact no one uses them. Also, hiding content like that is just bad right?</li>
<li><a href="#t=17:35">17:35</a> So my question for you sort of open-ended, I just was hoping to get a little window into what your organization style and workflow is like with SASS. Do you keep separate stylesheets and import them all? Do you keep everything organized in one file like classic CSS? I’d just like to get some advice from someone who’s been through the ropes a little bit and can help me write code I won’t cringe at when I look back at it years from now.</li>
<li><a href="#t=21:55">21:55</a> I want to be able to select &lt;li&gt;’s like how I would files my desktop. It looked like I could use jQuery UI, but…<a href="http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5771">it doesn’t support the Shift key for multiple select</a>. Do you have any suggestions for a plugin, Code Pen (plug), etc. that could help me out?</li>
<li><a href="#t=26:04">26:04</a> I have a question about uploading a site to the web. I work locally with localhost etc, and then put my files online via FTP. I have heard you mention this is now outdated and not best practice. What are the best alternatives to FTP and what are their benefits over FTP?</li>
<li><a href="#t=29:22">29:22</a> I have always styled the default state for links using the type element selector on the anchor element like a { styles… } but I have always wondered about the pseudo-class :link since it’s function is to style links that are in its default state maybe I should just be styling using :link { styles… } instead of on the anchor element? Then I wouldn’t have conflicting styles and the need to overwrite styles when using an anchor for wrapping divs and getting rid of those link styles.</li>
<li><a href="#t=33:12">33:12</a> I graduated with a comp-sci degree but found that I love to design as well as develop on the back end. Is there anyone out there that does this? Or is there always a clear cut break between the front end and back end? Is it good to blur these lines?</li>
<li><a href="#t=36:37">36:37</a> I would like to know if there are any workarounds for pixel rounding as-well as floating point rounding in browsers? My problem occurs when I make fluid grids. All browsers seem to round floating points differently which makes them inconsistent across browsers.</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:15">40:15</a> The agency I’m working at is starting to move toward more modular SCSS, following the SMACSS model. Jonathan Snook says that media queries should go next to the module that they affect. I think this approach will be way easier to maintain, since all the code for that module will be in one spot, but I’ve also heard people mention that this will lead to massive code bloat and performance issues. Are there performance issues with this? What kind of organizational model do you all follow with your SCSS to help with maintainability?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:46">44:46</a> I work for a small design/development agency. We are planning on redesigning our archaic website. How we build it is primarily up to me. The content will consist of media-rich case studies. It is currently on WordPress. Keeping it updated becomes so overwhelming and cumbersome that it never seems to happen. I am considering using Jekyll or perhaps some other static site compiler. Everyone in the company knows how to write markdown, and I feel that keeping the content updated via YAML or JSON would actually end up saving time. The whole site could be stored in a git repo and in my mind be much more flexible moving forward. Are there other compilers like Jekyll that I should consider? Is there anything you have found overwhelmingly difficult with this approach? Static files seem unprogressive yet in many ways they feel like a breath of fresh air.</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:01">51:01</a> What are best practices when using Gulp on a team? Should everyone always be running the latest versions of Gulp, NPM, SASS, etc? How should I deal with old Gulp files? Should I update them as I come across them, or maintain the same Gulp file across all projects? Do you have any other best practices for maintaining development environments between team members?</li>
<li><a href="#t=55:43">55:43</a> If you have a huge database driven web app, is it better to have an incomplete sitemap, or none at all? Do you see sitemaps themselves potentially becoming obsolete as search engines get smarter/better at finding their way around?</li>

		<itunes:summary>We&#8217;ve got another RAPID-FIRE for you this week! Nothing but questions and answers. That&#8217;s what you like, right? Ohhhh, yeah.
We answer questions about fonts on Windows PCs, CSS frameworks, carousels, organizing SASS files, deploying with rsync, unicorns, managing Gulp files, and more!
Q &#38; A:

2:27 After designing and creating a website on a Mac and getting everything looking pretty, I always get a bit disappointed when I come to look at the site on a PC. I find the font smoothing and colour management on OS X make everything look substantially nicer, particularly @font-face fonts. Adding a subtle text shadow to everything helps a bit but are there any plugins or other tools to improve font smoothing on the users’ screen? If not, is there anything you take care to avoid at the design stage to make the difference less apparent in the end product?
6:30 I&#8217;m used to building websites from scratch, but I&#8217;m getting into HTML5 frameworks. What is the best way to customize one of those frameworks?
11:55 How do you feel about condensing information into swiping carousel on mobile devices? Basically, if a site has 3 columns of informational text on desktop it will turn into a 1 column carousel with swiping functionality on mobile. Some of the designers like it because it provides more interactive/fun experience on mobile, as well as helping balance and shorten the page length. I feel like this has the same principle of regular hero sized carousels and the fact no one uses them. Also, hiding content like that is just bad right?
17:35 So my question for you sort of open-ended, I just was hoping to get a little window into what your organization style and workflow is like with SASS. Do you keep separate stylesheets and import them all? Do you keep everything organized in one file like classic CSS? I’d just like to get some advice from someone who’s been through the ropes a little bit and can help me write code I won’t cringe at when I look back at it years from now.
21:55 I want to be able to select &#60;li&#62;’s like how I would files my desktop. It looked like I could use jQuery UI, but…it doesn’t support the Shift key for multiple select. Do you have any suggestions for a plugin, Code Pen (plug), etc. that could help me out?
26:04 I have a question about uploading a site to the web. I work locally with localhost etc, and then put my files online via FTP. I have heard you mention this is now outdated and not best practice. What are the best alternatives to FTP and what are their benefits over FTP?
29:22 I have always styled the default state for links using the type element selector on the anchor element like a { styles… } but I have always wondered about the pseudo-class :link since it’s function is to style links that are in its default state maybe I should just be styling using :link { styles… } instead of on the anchor element? Then I wouldn’t have conflicting styles and the need to overwrite styles when using an anchor for wrapping divs and getting rid of those link styles.
33:12 I graduated with a comp-sci degree but found that I love to design as well as develop on the back end. Is there anyone out there that does this? Or is there always a clear cut break between the front end and back end? Is it good to blur these lines?
36:37 I would like to know if there are any workarounds for pixel rounding as-well as floating point rounding in browsers? My problem occurs when I make fluid grids. All browsers seem to round floating points differently which makes them inconsistent across browsers.
40:15 The agency I’m working at is starting to move toward more modular SCSS, following the SMACSS model. Jonathan Snook says that media queries should go next to the module that they affect.

<p>We answer questions about managing SVG files, Ruby on Rails vs PHP, jQuery&#8217;s new CSS framework, apps we&#8217;re thankful for, Image Source Set, style guides, and vacations.</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=1:59">1:59</a> How do you deal with minified SVGs with git? Do you commit the minified SVGs or keep the originals around? Do you put the minified files in a different location (i.e., build directory)? Do you copy the other images (PNGs, JPGs, etc) to that directory as well?</li>
<li><a href="#t=9:44">9:44</a> Why are so many web apps build with Ruby on Rails? What are the benefits over a PHP framework like CodeIgniter? What makes you sacrifice the simplicity and performance of PHP?</li>
<li><a href="#t=20:13">20:13</a> What do you think about jQuery’s new CSS framework? They seem to have big plans.</li>
<li><a href="#t=28:27">28:27</a> What software, app, repo, blog, website, or whatever would you thank the developers / designers for, and why? Maybe your listeners can take 2 minutes to tweet or email to let some lone devs or designers know they’re doing good, and maybe a whole load of people can have a better day today.</li>
<li><a href="#t=35:00">35:00</a> I know a lot has been done to get image src set, and I appreciate it. However, I am a bit worried it might have been wasted time. How can I decide what image size to serve when I have no clue about my user’s Internet speed or data plan? Perhaps the best option is to serve the best compromise and give users the option to access a bigger image. Are the good old CSS background image and media queries enough?</li>
<li><a href="#t=42:27">42:27</a> What&#8217;s the best way to deal with SVG icons? Is it best to put them inline or add them within the CSS as background-image url? What&#8217;s the best way to deal with different changes on hover (such as color changes)?</li>
<li><a href="#t=50:21">50:21</a> I’m working on a redesign for an old website. Should I begin by creating a style guide and then using it as a reference for myself or is the style guide born out of my redesign?</li>

We answer questions about managing SVG files, Ruby on Rails vs PHP, jQuery&#8217;s new CSS framework, apps we&#8217;re thankful for, Image Source Set, style guides, and vacations.
Q &#38; A:

1:59 How do you deal with minified SVGs with git? Do you commit the minified SVGs or keep the originals around? Do you put the minified files in a different location (i.e., build directory)? Do you copy the other images (PNGs, JPGs, etc) to that directory as well?
9:44 Why are so many web apps build with Ruby on Rails? What are the benefits over a PHP framework like CodeIgniter? What makes you sacrifice the simplicity and performance of PHP?
20:13 What do you think about jQuery’s new CSS framework? They seem to have big plans.
28:27 What software, app, repo, blog, website, or whatever would you thank the developers / designers for, and why? Maybe your listeners can take 2 minutes to tweet or email to let some lone devs or designers know they’re doing good, and maybe a whole load of people can have a better day today.
35:00 I know a lot has been done to get image src set, and I appreciate it. However, I am a bit worried it might have been wasted time.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andy Budd is a User Experience Designer and partner at Clear Left in Brighton, England.</p>
<p>He joins us to talk progressive enhancement, Safari #hotdrama, Dave&#8217;s new web app, and more.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>News’n’Links’n’Drama:</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=47:57">47:57</a> I am the team leader for the front-end team. I have some great developers that work with me, but sometimes I have a hard time conveying the fact that sometimes we have to do stuff on our websites that we don&#8217;t like to please the client. For example, the classic example where a client that wants to make sure everything works in IE9. How can I help my developers understand that we have to slowly educate the client, but in the end the client writes the check?</li>
<li><a href="#t=56:27">56:27</a> I have two questions for you. I was recently let go from an enterprise-level company and was not given a reason why. It took me by surprise and I’ve not been able to get an explanation despite asking multiple times and from different people in the organization. I’m having trouble finding the words to explain why I was let go to potential employers. Any advice as to what to say in interviews when the question comes up? My other question is addressing something that a recent potential employer called out. They said they normally wouldn’t consider me because I’ve not been with a job for more than about a year and that that’s a “red flag”. Is this a “red flag” with a lot of employers? Should I address this and if so, how?</li>

24:07 Progressive Enhancement: Thriving in Unpredictability by Tim Kadlec

Q &#38; A:

47:57 I am the team leader for the front-end team. I have some great developers that work with me, but sometimes I have a hard time conveying the fact that sometimes we have to do stuff on our websites that we don&#8217;t like to please the client. For example, the classic example where a client that wants to make sure everything works in IE9. How can I help my developers understand that we have to slowly educate the client, but in the end the client writes the check?
56:27 I have two questions for you. I was recently let go from an enterprise-level company and was not given a reason why. It took me by surprise and I’ve not been able to get an explanation despite asking multiple times and from different people in the organization. I’m having trouble finding the words to explain why I was let go to potential employers. Any advice as to what to say in interviews when the question comes up? My other question is addressing something that a recent potential employer called out. They said they normally wouldn’t consider me because I’ve not been with a job for more than about a year and that that’s a “red flag”. Is this a “red flag” with a lot of employers? Should I address this and if so, how?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tim Brown is the Type Manager for Adobe Typekit. He joins us this week for a deep dive into web typography.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=26:44">26:44</a> I like the Georgia font a lot and have used it for a lot of my designs. Recently I moved to Linux and realized that this font is not shipped by default on Linux. What should I do? I tried to find a web font version of Georgia but didn’t. Maybe I should try to find a web font which looks just as good?</li>
<li><a href="#t=31:02">31:02</a> If you had to build and support a site that caters to 90+ languages, how would you go about figuring out what font stacks you would need for each language? After you figured out that daunting chore how would you implement it?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:44">38:44</a> I am having some frustrations with fonts. It seems like every time I load up a google font it doesn’t look crisp. I don’t know where else to go for web fonts and for some reason the idea of paying for fonts every month doesn’t sit well with me and I don’t want to try a service without knowing if its good or not. How would you recommend going about finding, selecting, and maybe buying fonts for the web?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:20">51:20</a> I have a <a href="http://font-combinator.com">small web typography tool</a> where I list all of the fonts from the Google Fonts API. Currently, I have a dropdown menu, with each font listed by name, set <em>in</em> that typeface. So, the requirement is to have a dropdown where individual options can be styled.</li>
<li>You cannot style native &lt;option&gt; elements within a &lt;select&gt;, so I’m currently using a jQuery Library called Chosen (http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/) to produce a stylable drop down. It works by basically hijacking the &lt;select&gt; element and replacing it with a bunch of &lt;div&gt;s.</li>
<li>In my next rev of this tool I’m looking to ditch jQuery altogether (as a learning experience), but am stumped about what to do with the drop downs.</li>
<li>My question to you is: Are you aware of any way to style &lt;option&gt; elements? Are you aware of any vanilla-JS methods of hijacking a &lt;select&gt; menu (the way Chosen does)? Or, do you have any thoughts on how to approach this in a different way altogether? I’m also concerned with accessibility, so I’d like to keep that in mind.</li>
<li><a href="#t=59:30">59:30</a> I remember when I first started learning web design, I took a class at the local community college. My professor said something that I found odd. We were talking about the &lt;link&gt; tag, and including external stylesheets. He mentioned the “text/css” property, and that apparently the W3C foresaw stylesheets that weren’t created as text. I can’t imagine any other way, and I haven’t been able to find anything else about this. I was wondering if you guys might know what this is all about. My professor may’ve been misinformed, but why include the “type,” if there’s only one possible value?</li>
<li><a href="#t=1:02:32">1:02:32</a> I want to use Typecast but you need one of these font accounts: (Font Deck, Google Web Fonts, Fonts.com, Typekit, Web Type) Which are your favorites?</li>

<li><a href="#t=46:20">46:20</a> In a previous episode there was some talk about how important it is to have a Github profile when searching for jobs. I was wondering if you had any tips on how to build a good Github profile if, like me, you’re not quite the Github type. What would you do if your time was limited, but you feel like having a showcase of code on Github is the only way to get noticed by the companies you’d like to work for?</li>

31:57 Hi Lara! I know you work a lot with WordPress. What do you think of the new Layers Site Builder on Envato?
41:10 Hi Lara! It’s Ben, your brother. Hope you’re doing a great job on your Shoptalk show thus far. I’m not sure if you’ve admitted this to anybody, but I will: Lara grew up on a llama farm for the first 18 years of her life with me. Lara, I’d like you to tell everyone what kind of impact the llamas have had on your very successful web design and consulting career.
46:20 In a previous episode there was some talk about how important it is to have a Github profile when searching for jobs. I was wondering if you had any tips on how to build a good Github profile if, like me, you’re not quite the Github type. What would you do if your time was limited, but you feel like having a showcase of code on Github is the only way to get noticed by the companies you’d like to work for?

<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:19">3:19</a> I’ve noticed that in recent years, more and more Google is doing a good job of cementing a consistent look and feel across all of its products. I was wondering, do you guys think that we would ever seen a HTML/CSS/JS framework from Google? Is there such a framework already that I just don’t know about?</li>
<li><a href="#t=11:15">11:15</a> Eight months ago I quit my job at a startup to freelance on my own, which has been going great. And just six weeks ago, two good friends quit their jobs to join me in forming a 3-man web design/development studio. So, this question is for Dave in regards to your Paravel experience. Do you have any advice, insight or just straight up ramblings about forming and working with a small team of friends and how the three of you got Paravel to a point where you were doing work for high-profile clients like Microsoft?</li>
<li><a href="#t=20:51">20:51</a> I am relatively new to front end design/development. I have recently had my eyes opened to the world of preprocessing. I have dabbled with using Mixture and am now thinking about Gulping it up. Can you summarize the pros and cons of Gulp/Grunt vs Mixture/Codekit?</li>
<li><a href="#t=29:47">29:47</a> I’m an avid conference goer and every now and then, I get the chance to sit down with one or many conference speakers for a drink or lunch, etc. I know for me personally, I don’t always like to talk about work or what I do when I’m trying to relax and enjoy a drink or social event. So the question is: if you are talking with someone you respect, what should the topic of discussion be? Would you want to talk about what devs/designers do in the field or would it be “out of bounds” to talk about more personal things, like family, children, other hobbies, etc? If you mention it in a talk or discussion, is it fair to ask about those things?</li>
<li><a href="#t=34:55">34:55</a> What are your tips for becoming a lifelong blogger?</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:34">47:34</a> What are your thoughts on using Jekyll instead of WordPress for websites where most of the updates will be to something like a listing of events?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:40">51:40</a> I’m no expert in SEO but I was wondering what are some of the best practices regarding meta tags? It seems nowadays like some tags are redundant, i.e. the keywords tag. What tags do you consider essential to your website?</li>
<li><a href="#t=56:53">56:53</a> I’ve got a quick question about accessibility, more precisely about the ARIA role attributes. So I’ve been using them in web projects for a while now, but only for the main header or main navigation. Can you use one role multiple times on a page for example for a sub-navigation? And what would you recommend in terms of quantity, so what would be a good amount of roles between none and way too many?</li>
<li><a href="#t=1:01:41">1:01:41</a> I was trying to think how to implement the page loading progress bar kinda like the one on Youtube, along with loading the pages with ajax for smoothing the UI, do you guys have any resources for synchronizing these two things?</li>

17:45 What do you think about Unsuck the Web?
26:41 New Theme Song! Thanks, Chris Taylor!
26:58 Our podcast editor, Aaron Dowd, started a podcast to help you learn how to podcast.

Q &#38; A:

28:21 I work at a company where I sometimes create small Javascript games for social media campaigns. I find it hard to code interactive things that support both mouse events and touch events. I haven’t found any good libraries that can help me with this. Any suggestions?
35:41 How fluent do I need to be at JavaScript before identifying as a Front End Developer?
43:02 I’ve got a question about Github/Open Source etiquette. I built a simple javascript module for creating resizable containers and open sourced it on Github. This is my first legit open source project, and I’ve had a positive response from the community. It’s been fun and rewarding seeing people modify my code and use it in their own projects. That said, I have a pull request that makes some great changes, but it also has some changes that I’d rather omit. Is there a “correct” way to merge PART of their code while still giving them credit?
53:13 I am currently in the navy as an aviation electronics technician. I am separating form the navy and plan to go to jr. college in the fall. Over the years I’ve developed a fascination over A.I./machine learning, however I originally joined the navy to use the G.I. bill to go to school for graphic design / web design. If I learn web design during school, would that knowledge benefit towards skills used for A.I., or would it be time better spent learning the languages needed for A.I.?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another RAPID-FIRE for you this week; nothing but questions from our dear listeners and answers from your favorite podcast&#8217;s hosts.</p>
<p>We answer questions about hosting client sites pre-launch, CSS animation libraries, dealing with burnout, merge conflicts, deploying WordPress sites, code portfolios, the importance of blogging and where you should publish your content, metrics to consider when re-designing a website, working with WordPress&#8217;s REST API, and more.</p>
<p><strong>We talked about (roughly in order):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:26">3:26</a> I’m a bit confused about how can a client have remote access to a project during development, before it goes live. Is it a personal server on an old PC, a paid web hosting service, a free web hosting service, a repository (like GitHub) or something else?</li>
<li><a href="#t=11:31">11:31</a> I just started with a new agency where I’m leading the entire team. I’m trying to push doing more CSS3 animations on hover effects and not worrying about supplying older browsers with that animation. The team has used GreenSock.js to handle animations cross browser. I argue that using a library like GreenSock is fine for large complicated animations but hover effects and minor effects we should move to pure css3 and keyframes. Am I going overboard with this thinking or should I back off and let the team continue to use something like GreenSock?</li>
<li><a href="#t=19:25">19:25</a> I have been actively working in some area of the web industry for the last 12 years. Currently 30 years old and have my dream job as a Director for a great company. I have always had times of feeling burnt out and needing to take a break over the years. Now with a young family, house, hobbies etc. I find that these seasons are turning from weeks to months. Any tips on how to break out of the rut? How do you guys continue to stay excited about the industry and furthering your knowledge and skill sets?</li>
<li><a href="#t=25:30">25:30</a> We use git for version control and follow the git flow model, mostly. We’re getting into a bit of a kerfuffle with our compiled CSS. A few developers might be working on the front end, on different branches, with SASS which then compiles to a CSS file. Then BOOM SHAKE THE ROOM, we have a merge conflict. All the .scss files are fine but that compiled and compressed style.css is an abomination. How do you lot deal with this kind of thing? It’s been suggested that we .gitignore style.css and compile on the server when we push the site but I’m against that for some reason or other. Is there a better way?</li>
<li><a href="#t=33:00">33:00</a> How should I handle the wp-config.php file when deploying a WordPress site? I use Beanstalk and I’m working alone. I’m struggling with this because there are essentially three different versions of the wp-config: local, staging and production. Should I put it in .gitignore and just manually create it on the staging and production servers?</li>
<li><a href="#t=36:48">36:48</a> GitHub has always been a standard for developers and having an online code portfolio. However I like CodePen much better and seems to have a great user base. How do you decide which platform to use, or should I focus on platform for code bits? Secondly, for blogging, should I use a platform like CodePen blogs since I have no audience, or should I do my own thing?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:34">44:34</a> I’m redesigning and reengineering an organization’s website from scratch. I have clear design goals but want to show objective engineering gains as well, what are the best metrics to compare before and after a redesign? Page-size and load time are obvious, but what other ones should I be thinking about?</li>
<li><a href="#t=50:15">50:15</a> How did the trend of photoshopping your face into an astronaut’s helmet start? I see this in a lot of profile pics. I’m considering joining the craze but I’d like to know the full history before jumping in. Is there something that I’m missing?</li>
<li><a href="#t=52:48">52:48</a> I learned web development and templating through WordPress, like many other people. With the coming WordPress REST API, I’m looking to play around and learn another method for front end development that pulls site data from the WordPress REST API’s JSON output, and therefore I don’t have any backend prerequisites. If you could go completely greenfield with no client requirements, what route would you most want to take to learn a new thing?</li>
<li><a href="#t=1:00:43">1:00:43</a> What are your thoughts about how one should effectively serve retina images? I read this old blogpost by Jensen in which he was able to bypass the use of retina.js, cookies, or extra server-side stuff to serve high-res images on Retina screens. What IS the best way and what makes it the best way?</li>

We answer questions about hosting client sites pre-launch, CSS animation libraries, dealing with burnout, merge conflicts, deploying WordPress sites, code portfolios, the importance of blogging and where you should publish your content, metrics to consider when re-designing a website, working with WordPress&#8217;s REST API, and more.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another RAPID-FIRE for you this week; nothing but HOT question and answer madness.</p>
<p>We answer questions about package management, inline-css, CSS frameworks, code editors, testing, and more!</p>
<p><strong>We talked about (roughly in order):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=4:44">4:44</a> Is it my lack of experience, or do the dependencies on Node and Ruby projects regularly break your projects as the gems / packages are updated?</li>
<li><a href="#t=12:56">12:56</a> On show 155 you talked about inline CSS and cases where it might be ok to use. The one case where it&#8217;s useful is when you want a dynamically served image to fill it&#8217;s containing element, while being centered within in it. Case in point: a WordPress Featured image, that acts as the hero image. If that image is inserted inline as a background image on a &lt;figure&gt; or “&lt;div&gt;, you can simply set the style of that element to be background-size: cover, and background-position: center in your style-sheet, and have it fill the container, without relying on any extra JS or CSS transforms to achieve the same effect.</li>
<li><a href="#t=20:22">20:22</a> I&#8217;ve only briefly experimented with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and 960 Grid, but my cursory evaluations have led mainly to frustration. I like being in complete control of my code, and I like knowing there aren&#8217;t a myriad of classes unknown to me that are affecting the behavior of the elements I&#8217;m trying to work with. It feels like I&#8217;m constantly fighting against the framework to make things behave exactly how I want. It just seems these frameworks are adding a layer of complexity rather than making things simpler. So, my question: am I viewing CSS frameworks incorrectly &#8211; perhaps a more thorough exposure to the framework in use will open my eyes to its usefulness? Or are CSS frameworks just not for me?</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:00">30:00</a> What are your thoughts on https://atom.io/ ? Seems like pretty good editor, even better than sublime.</li>
<li><a href="#t=41:13">41:13</a> I&#8217;m taking a course on HTML5, CSS and JS at my university in Sweden. They have decided that frameworks like Bootstrap are not allowed because of the risk of plagiarism, due to a previous incident where a student bought a complete website and submitted as a final project. As a result they have now banned use of any use of frameworks, including things like jQuery. What are your thoughts on this approach?I think using pure JS takes the joy out of making awesome websites.</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:16">47:16</a> Hey guys, just listening to the latest episode with Bastian Allgeier, maker of the Kirby CMS, which I love. You guys were talking a bit about workflows with Kirby. I use Kirby on my site and just wanted to show off my awesome Kirby workflow:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>I keep the code for my site on Github.</li>
<li>I keep the &#8216;content&#8217; folder in Dropbox.</li>
<li>I install Dropbox on my server.</li>
<li>I use Capistrano to deploy the code from Github to my server, and then have Capistrano create a symlink inside the Kirby CMS folder, pointing to the Dropbox &#8216;content&#8217; folder. <em>BAM</em></li>
</ol>
<p>That way I can mess around with stuff, while keeping my content out of harms way. Also, for creating new content, I use nvALT (using markdown of course) on my Mac, which has a sweet preview panel that you can customize with your own CSS and HTML, so you get a real live preview of your posts with the exact same stylesheets that are on your website.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=50:42">50:42</a> I&#8217;ve recently been trying to write more tests for my web apps. This works well for functions since I can say, “With this input, expect this output.” But what about for user interfaces? What is your approach to making sure that your changes do not mess with the existing UI when working on a team? Any continuous integration tools?</li>

If that image is inserted inline as a background image on a &#60;figure&#62; or “&#60;div&#62;, you can simply set the style of that element to be background-size: cover, and background-position: center in your style-sheet, and have it fill the container, without relying on any extra JS or CSS transforms to achieve the same effect.
20:22 I&#8217;ve only briefly experimented with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and 960 Grid, but my cursory evaluations have led mainly to frustration. I like being in complete control of my code, and I like knowing there aren&#8217;t a myriad of classes unknown to me that are affecting the behavior of the elements I&#8217;m trying to work with. It feels like I&#8217;m constantly fighting against the framework to make things behave exactly how I want. It just seems these frameworks are adding a layer of complexity rather than making things simpler. So, my question: am I viewing CSS frameworks incorrectly &#8211; perhaps a more thorough exposure to the framework in use will open my eyes to its usefulness? Or are CSS frameworks just not for me?
30:00 What are your thoughts on https://atom.io/ ? Seems like pretty good editor, even better than sublime.
41:13 I&#8217;m taking a course on HTML5, CSS and JS at my university in Sweden. They have decided that frameworks like Bootstrap are not allowed because of the risk of plagiarism, due to a previous incident where a student bought a complete website and submitted as a final project. As a result they have now banned use of any use of frameworks, including things like jQuery. What are your thoughts on this approach?I think using pure JS takes the joy out of making awesome websites.
47:16 Hey guys, just listening to the latest episode with Bastian Allgeier, maker of the Kirby CMS, which I love. You guys were talking a bit about workflows with Kirby. I use Kirby on my site and just wanted to show off my awesome Kirby workflow:


I keep the code for my site on Github.
I keep the &#8216;content&#8217; folder in Dropbox.
I install Dropbox on my server.
I use Capistrano to deploy the code from Github to my server, and then have Capistrano create a symlink inside the Kirby CMS folder, pointing to the Dropbox &#8216;content&#8217; folder. BAM

That way I can mess around with stuff, while keeping my content out of harms way. Also, for creating new content, I use nvALT (using markdown of course) on my Mac, which has a sweet preview panel that you can customize with your own CSS and HTML, so you get a real live preview of your posts with the exact same stylesheets that are on your website.

50:42 I&#8217;ve recently been trying to write more tests for my web apps. This works well for functions since I can say, “With this input, expect this output.” But what about for user interfaces? What is your approach to making sure that your changes do not mess with the existing UI when working on a team? Any continuous integration tools?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tim Holman is an Australian developer with a strong focus on design and interactivity. He currently lives in New York and is working as a product engineer at Tumblr.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>News’n’Links’n’Drama:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=9:56">9:56</a> Justin L. wrote in: “I really appreciate the advice you guys gave and it really motivated me to finish my portfolio and get a new job. It definitely was a culture problem at my job and I think this is a serious problem that many people face. I took my time a <a href="http://www.justrlax.com/">created a strong portfolio that I&#8217;m proud of</a>. After I put it live, I got a new job within a week at <a href="http://realart.com/">this firm</a>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=22:24">22:24</a> How do you find living and working in New York vs Australia? Do you feel more inspired being in such a tech focused city or does the &#8216;rat race&#8217; burn you out a little? What level of impact has this new environment had on your skill progression?</li>
<li><a href="#t=27:50">27:50</a> Recently I&#8217;ve been seeing homepage CSS Animations that simulate an app or website running &#8211; see bitly.com or venmo.com. In these animations, the text is live text and CSS driven, and NOT a video or a set of JPG images simulating animation. My question is, do people hand code these? or is there some tool I don&#8217;t know about that makes these timeline driven animations easier?</li>
<li><a href="#t=32:38">32:38</a> I&#8217;m a front-end developer and I use a mobile first approach when building websites. When I&#8217;m given the designs for a site to start building I&#8217;m seeing components on the page that have been removed from the mobile design but are there on the desktop / tablet view. I try to explain there has to be a very good reason to remove content on mobile view as each device should have the same experience for the user and it can be very frustrating if content changes depending on what device they are using. Their argument is on the mobile phone, users won&#8217;t want to read posts and it will just make the page longer as everything stacks on top of each other. I explain you don&#8217;t know what users are going to use the site for and people know how to scroll the page. What do you guys think?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:02">40:02</a> I&#8217;m a 33 year old former self employed photographer trying to break into the web industry. I&#8217;m a completely self taught designer/developer with experiences in HTML, CSS, PHP, WordPress, Rails and Javascript/jQuery. My question is&#8230; How do you stand out in a field with so many talented people without a killer resume as a 33 year old advanced beginner?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:26">44:26</a> I run the membership system for a national sports organization in Australia. I sometimes get complaints from one particular state about the system being slow, or a certain function not doing what it should. When I try to replicate these issues, I am not able to do so. Do you guys use or know of any tools that allow you to test drive a client&#8217;s computer remotely and run diagnostics on things like internet speed to get a better understanding of what is causing the problem?</li>
<li><a href="#t=52:00">52:00</a> Hey guys so what are your thoughts about this hamburger trend that has become quite popular for the last few years, Facebook already stopped using it as a main button in it&#8217;s app but a lot designers out there still using it even in desktop sites, what you guys think of it?</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ben Callahan is the President of Sparkbox, the founder of the Build Right workshop series, and an author and speaker.</p>
<p><strong>We talked about (roughly in order):</strong></p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=21:10">21:10</a> I have been working as a front end developer for a design firm. They seem to always want to use templates to start projects with. I&#8217;ve built them a &#8220;starter kit&#8221; to try and ween them off using templates. Am I wrong for trying to do this? Is it better for the client and the entire workflow? Is this something that is common in other design / development firms?</li>
<li><a href="#t=26:30">26:30</a> As we know, Ben co-owns Sparkbox, which means that all 3 of you have made the transition from being a web designer to running your own business. If you could go back and tell your younger, naive self just getting started with running a business one thing, what would that be? Similarly, what advice do you have for ShopTalk listeners who are thinking about moving from just working in the industry to owning or running a business in the industry?</li>
<li><a href="#t=37:48">37:48</a> How do you facilitate communication between designers, developers, managers, and clients at Sparkbox? Do you find projects done in the open (like CodePen) help that relationship through transparency?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:01">44:01</a> What are your thoughts on t. domains?</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:13">47:13</a> I&#8217;ve been learning web development for 6 months. I have now started looking for remote entry level jobs as I can&#8217;t afford to move out of the city at this time. However I&#8217;m not quite sure if I&#8217;m jumping the gun on my job hunt as I am very young in my learning experience and haven&#8217;t done much. I hear hear many people say &#8220;oh, just one or two decent projects is fine. Your passion is most important.&#8221; I have a lot of passion for this!So my question is: am I looking too soon?</li>
<li><a href="#t=50:20">50:20</a> How can I apply an overlay to an element or to my entire screen that blurs everything &#8220;behind&#8221; it? I am well aware of the filter: blur(xpx) method; however, it is my understanding that that method only works with images. What if I also wanted to blur other things &#8212; such as a nav menu, text, a form, buttons, or really anything OTHER than a simple image? Is this even possible?</li>
<li><a href="#t=53:21">53:21</a> In a world of style guides (Salesforce / Lonely Planet&#8217;s Rizzo / Starbucks / Bootstrap, etc&#8230;), how does the CMS fit into all this? Are there any good examples of style guide usage out there rather than just flat HTML &#8216;lifeless&#8217; pretty looking docs? I&#8217;d love to see a working WordPress style guide.</li>

		<itunes:summary>Ben Callahan is the President of Sparkbox, the founder of the Build Right workshop series, and an author and speaker.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

21:10 I have been working as a front end developer for a design firm. They seem to always want to use templates to start projects with. I&#8217;ve built them a &#8220;starter kit&#8221; to try and ween them off using templates. Am I wrong for trying to do this? Is it better for the client and the entire workflow? Is this something that is common in other design / development firms?
26:30 As we know, Ben co-owns Sparkbox, which means that all 3 of you have made the transition from being a web designer to running your own business. If you could go back and tell your younger, naive self just getting started with running a business one thing, what would that be? Similarly, what advice do you have for ShopTalk listeners who are thinking about moving from just working in the industry to owning or running a business in the industry?
37:48 How do you facilitate communication between designers, developers, managers, and clients at Sparkbox? Do you find projects done in the open (like CodePen) help that relationship through transparency?
44:01 What are your thoughts on t. domains?
47:13 I&#8217;ve been learning web development for 6 months. I have now started looking for remote entry level jobs as I can&#8217;t afford to move out of the city at this time. However I&#8217;m not quite sure if I&#8217;m jumping the gun on my job hunt as I am very young in my learning experience and haven&#8217;t done much. I hear hear many people say &#8220;oh, just one or two decent projects is fine. Your passion is most important.&#8221; I have a lot of passion for this!So my question is: am I looking too soon?
50:20 How can I apply an overlay to an element or to my entire screen that blurs everything &#8220;behind&#8221; it? I am well aware of the filter: blur(xpx) method; however, it is my understanding that that method only works with images. What if I also wanted to blur other things &#8212; such as a nav menu, text, a form, buttons, or really anything OTHER than a simple image? Is this even possible?
53:21 In a world of style guides (Salesforce / Lonely Planet&#8217;s Rizzo / Starbucks / Bootstrap, etc&#8230;), how does the CMS fit into all this? Are there any good examples of style guide usage out there rather than just flat HTML &#8216;lifeless&#8217; pretty looking docs? I&#8217;d love to see a working WordPress style guide.

<p>We answer questions about taking over a web service, if you should focus on building a team or a product first, carousel sliders, the merits of cover letters, grid systems, Flexbox, disruption in the web design industry, and more.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=2:51">2:51</a> I have the opportunity to build a &#8220;new and improved&#8221; product for a pre-existing web service, with over 1,000 paying users. The original company has no desire to pursue this product and will share the majority of the profits if we take over operations, so upon launch we will have over a 1,000 customers to convert! But, my business partner thinks we should focus on building a company before the product. What would you focus on first? The company or the product?</li>
<li><a href="#t=11:28">11:28</a> On the show, you reference Owl Carousel quite a bit. This is a great plugin &amp; as worked seamless for my projects. Problem is, I&#8217;m looking for a plugin that don&#8217;t invoke any libraries or jQuery dependancies. Any recommendations?</li>
<li><a href="#t=19:32">19:32</a> What do you guys think about cover letters?</li>
<li><a href="#t=24:15">24:15</a> What are your thoughts on using a typography style sheet partial?</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:52">30:52</a> I&#8217;ve never found much use for grid systems because I prefer to hand code my layouts. Recently I discovered Susy and I&#8217;ve started to change my mind. I&#8217;m curious what you guys think about Susy and what kind of grid system, if any, you use?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:43">38:43</a> Is thegrid.io going to replace web design?</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:57">47:57</a> What&#8217;s your take on using &#8220;data-ng-value&#8221; (or &#8220;x-ng-value&#8221;) versus just using &#8220;ng-value&#8221; on your markup? The former is better for wc3 validation, but does it matter in the long run if you stick with using the latter? Are there any major repercussions, aside from getting a whole lotta red when validating your HTML5 markup?</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another RAPID-FIRE for you this week; nothing but HOT question and answer madness.</p>
<p>We answered questions about sidebar layouts, Linux as a dev environment, authentication in rails apps, managing personal and business branding and social media, salaries for junior developers, automated pre-launch testing, and managing WordPress databases. Dave also reveals his secret desire to switch to Windows for a year.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=4:08">4:08</a> My question is about empty sidebars on long &#8220;pages&#8221; (trying to get away form using that word). Many websites have a sidebar column floated to one side of the viewport, and once you scroll past the content in the sidebar it&#8217;s empty space. Is there a good fix for this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=10:12">10:12</a> It seems that in webdev land, Mac is the king, Windows is a footnote, and Linux is the redheaded step-child that nobody talks about. What do you guys think about Linux as a developer environment?</li>
<li><a href="#t=19:27">19:27</a> So I have this&#8230; uh&#8230; friend&#8230; who&#8217;s building a Rails app and he, I mean she, is wondering about Authentication. Rails has this gem called Devise and there&#8217;s two standard plugins that aren&#8217;t enabled by default: Confirmable and Lockable. Confirmable will send email confirmation to verify accounts. This seems pretty standard right? Lockable will lock out the account after a few failed attempts. Should she enable both of those?</li>
<li><a href="#t=26:32">26:32</a> How do you guys strike a balance between your personal and business brands across all social platforms? How do you decide if a tweet should be from your personal account or business account? When do you cross promote? Do your messages change across platforms? Do you simply repeat the same post on twitter, facebook, google+, etc or do you adjust your message based on the platform?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:23">38:23</a> What do you think about employers willing to pay $20/hour or less with junior (front-end) developers? Does salary raise any red flags?</li>
<li><a href="#t=42:33">42:33</a> Have you ever used, or know of any existing tools that use JS automation to check things on a pre-launch checklist?</li>
<li><a href="#t=49:44">49:44</a> Is there a point that WP suffers a performance hit due to a large database?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Another RAPID-FIRE for you this week; nothing but HOT question and answer madness.
We answered questions about sidebar layouts, Linux as a dev environment, authentication in rails apps, managing personal and business branding and social media, salaries for junior developers, automated pre-launch testing, and managing WordPress databases. Dave also reveals his secret desire to switch to Windows for a year.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

4:08 My question is about empty sidebars on long &#8220;pages&#8221; (trying to get away form using that word). Many websites have a sidebar column floated to one side of the viewport, and once you scroll past the content in the sidebar it&#8217;s empty space. Is there a good fix for this?
10:12 It seems that in webdev land, Mac is the king, Windows is a footnote, and Linux is the redheaded step-child that nobody talks about. What do you guys think about Linux as a developer environment?
19:27 So I have this&#8230; uh&#8230; friend&#8230; who&#8217;s building a Rails app and he, I mean she, is wondering about Authentication. Rails has this gem called Devise and there&#8217;s two standard plugins that aren&#8217;t enabled by default: Confirmable and Lockable. Confirmable will send email confirmation to verify accounts. This seems pretty standard right? Lockable will lock out the account after a few failed attempts. Should she enable both of those?
26:32 How do you guys strike a balance between your personal and business brands across all social platforms? How do you decide if a tweet should be from your personal account or business account? When do you cross promote? Do your messages change across platforms? Do you simply repeat the same post on twitter, facebook, google+, etc or do you adjust your message based on the platform?
38:23 What do you think about employers willing to pay $20/hour or less with junior (front-end) developers? Does salary raise any red flags?
42:33 Have you ever used, or know of any existing tools that use JS automation to check things on a pre-launch checklist?
49:44 Is there a point that WP suffers a performance hit due to a large database?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Addy Osmoni is an engineer at Google, where he works on Chrome &amp; Polymer. Addy is also the creator of TodoMVC, @Yeoman, Web Starter Kit, and the author of JavaScript Design Patterns.</p>
<p>He joined us to talk frameworks, performance, JavaScript, and more.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=15:48">15:48</a> What is the best way for someone to pursue a similar career at Google or elsewhere?</li>
<li><a href="#t=19:44">19:44</a> At what point you make the trade-off between additional bytes of file-size vs. an extra HTTP request. Basically, at what point does the extra HTTP request become worthwhile? 5kb, 10kb, 50kb?</li>
<li><a href="#t=33:55">33:55</a>  I will be rebuilding our website and app dashboard soon, and instead of having a desktop version and a mobile version, I’m going have just 1 version which will support both. I would like to use a different set of js files for the smallest i.e.: mobile version, vs the desktop size or rather anything bigger then the mobile version which in my case would be 320px. I’ve seen examples of people using JavaScript to import script tags, but how would you guys go about this?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Addy Osmoni is an engineer at Google, where he works on Chrome &#38; Polymer. Addy is also the creator of TodoMVC, @Yeoman, Web Starter Kit, and the author of JavaScript Design Patterns.
He joined us to talk frameworks, performance, JavaScript, and more.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

15:48 What is the best way for someone to pursue a similar career at Google or elsewhere?
19:44 At what point you make the trade-off between additional bytes of file-size vs. an extra HTTP request. Basically, at what point does the extra HTTP request become worthwhile? 5kb, 10kb, 50kb?
33:55  I will be rebuilding our website and app dashboard soon, and instead of having a desktop version and a mobile version, I’m going have just 1 version which will support both. I would like to use a different set of js files for the smallest i.e.: mobile version, vs the desktop size or rather anything bigger then the mobile version which in my case would be 320px. I’ve seen examples of people using JavaScript to import script tags, but how would you guys go about this?
40:58 I am so frustrated with the current state of JavaScript. I feel like there are so many libraries and tools that the language is getting over saturated. Because of this over saturation there are now conflicting best practices. For example, if we want to use requireJS and concatenate all of our libraries together, then we cannot use a CDN fallback for those libraries. So, do we do AMD or CDN?
45:35 I’ve recently begun diving into the MEAN stack, and so far, have really enjoyed it. Coming from a LAMP stack background, it&#8217;s been a pretty big huge mindset shift, but the idea of running a server on JavaScript is both too terrifying and too intriguing to pass up. What do you guys think about the MEAN stack?
50:55 As a front and back end developer I often find myself Googling pretty much anything from a CSS to PHP. For example, today I searched for &#8220;SASS Parent Selectors&#8221; and &#8220;Equal height columns in CSS.&#8221; I often think that I&#8217;m just good at searching the web and not so much at development, am I overreacting or do other developers run into this situation?
53:42 Can you explain what &#8220;The tiniest yet most powerful JS utility ever&#8221; is all about?
56:12 The NYTimes is describing some of the technology they used for their re-design. Including a paragraph about responsiveness and breakpoints called &#8216;A smarter layout&#8217;.

They decided to go for CSS classes set via JavaScript to switch the layout. So like Modernizr-is-taking-care-of-mediaqueries-ish-kinda-way. What do you think about this approach?

<li><a href="#t=27:24">27:24</a> I&#8217;ve recently started a small WordPress blog with a few friends. I tell them to make sure they fill out important fields before posting articles (featured images, categories, etc). I still find that they often forget these fields.

<li><a href="#t=30:03">30:03</a> My company&#8217;s sites have some duplicated content. How badly does this affect our Google page rank for products?</li>

<li><a href="#t=42:43">42:43</a> I&#8217;d like to show a different design (different JS, CSS, and content) to mobile users on my WordPress site. Any advice for me?</li>
<li><a href="#t=49:14">49:14</a> The other day I stumbled upon The Grid. Their goal seems to be automating the website layout and design process based on a users content via Ai and machine learning. How do you guys feel this will effect the website design industry? Since this looks pretty straightforward for anyone to use, will this cause for designers to start moving into development?</li>

<li><a href="#t=59:23">59:23</a> I was wondering if, considering the native features of the browsers stay extending, jQuery UI still made sense? Do you use it, or should I avoid it? Also, do you ever use jQuery Mobile? What were your experiences?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Alex Russell is a developer working on Chrome, Blink, and the Web Platform Team at Google in San Francisco. He also serves on ECMA TC39 (the standards body for JavaScript) and the W3C Technical Architecture Group.
He took us on a deep dive into the future of the web, web components, standards, and more.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

52:24 My question is about &#8220;offline-first&#8221; and the (proposed?) &#8220;service workers&#8221; API. If I want to implement offline-first in my web apps, should I wait for service workers or just start learning the appcache stuff now?
59:23 I was wondering if, considering the native features of the browsers stay extending, jQuery UI still made sense? Do you use it, or should I avoid it? Also, do you ever use jQuery Mobile? What were your experiences?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anna Debenham is a freelance Front-End Developer based in the UK. She started finding clients when she was 18 and never looked back.</p>
<p>In this episode, she shared some great advice about how to get started as a web freelancer. We also discussed handing off projects to clients, working with Flexbox, how to present work to clients remotely, how to come up with awesome job titles for yourself, and more.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=17:08">17:08</a> I always wanted to be a contractor, I consider myself a cool (not as cool as Anna Debenham) front end, but I cannot step on the contractor world. Since you work that way, what are your steps to get into it?</li>
<li><a href="#t=22:08">22:08</a> Dave talked about “Tiny bootstraps” for each client. I really like this idea, but am curious what that looks like for you in practice. Do you deliver a folder of sass partials for them to work with, or do you have a minified stylesheet and a style guide with classes that they can use?</li>
<li><a href="#t=31:53">31:53</a> As I was just about to write a small Flexbox grid system, a coworker (let&#8217;s call him Big Time Timmy Jim) showed me this article about how you shouldn&#8217;t use Flexbox for major layout things because paint times drop significantly. The author&#8217;s answer is to use the grid spec, but that&#8217;s pretty far in the future with not much browser support today.What are your thoughts on this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=41:34">41:34</a> I&#8217;ve recently taken the jump to full-time client work and I have a question regarding working remotely. When it comes time to present a concept for a new site how do you prefer to demonstrate it to a client who is hundreds of miles away? I’ve heard of designers using video and web-based prototyping and I’d love to hear what’s worked well for you.</li>
<li><a href="#t=49:41">49:41</a> Is there a place for someone who is both a designer and a front-end developer? How do you describe to a potential employer that you can in fact do both, and want to do both?</li>
<li><a href="#t=55:12">55:12</a> I am from France and I do HTML/CSS and a little JS for a web agency. I do not do the ux and the ui design, my mate Clément does it. I never know if I should say &#8220;front end developer&#8221; (because I don&#8217;t do the development of our web-applications) or &#8220;front end designer&#8221; (because I don&#8217;t ux/ui design). What should I call myself?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Anna Debenham is a freelance Front-End Developer based in the UK. She started finding clients when she was 18 and never looked back.
In this episode, she shared some great advice about how to get started as a web freelancer. We also discussed handing off projects to clients, working with Flexbox, how to present work to clients remotely, how to come up with awesome job titles for yourself, and more.

49:41 Is there a place for someone who is both a designer and a front-end developer? How do you describe to a potential employer that you can in fact do both, and want to do both?

10:54 The web isn&#8217;t ready for 60fps

Q &#38; A:

19:25 When do you decide to go for a self-made theme or to hunt for a paid theme that comes close to what your customer wants?
25:04 I often read about &#8220;prototyping&#8221; using bootstrap, foundation, etc. Does this mean building a prototype site (with minimum design and code) and after some kind of approval step, then begin building the real project with new code? Is this a regular practice?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dan Denney is a front-end dev at Code School and the founder of Front-End Conf.</p>
<p>Dan shared his workflow for sending HTML email, we took a deep dive into Mandrill, discussed our current build processes, how to get a team up to modern development standards, and more.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=23:54">23:54</a> What are you using for your build process when developing?</li>
<li><a href="#t=31:49">31:49</a> I work for a large software company and enjoy my work but, we have weekly meetings discussing non-software things. How can I give feedback about these meetings without sounding like a jerk?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:20">40:20</a> I just landed a gig as a developer at a local marketing agency. From my understanding they have been using back-end developers to develop the front-end of websites. They also use designers with focus in print to create web designs and tackle usability. The designers and developers alike have been resistant to modern web best practices. The phrase &#8220;pixel perfect&#8221; is often used and it is expected that the final product be a mirror image of the mockup. With experience in UX, mobile, and performance I would like to bring them up to speed in the modern era of web development. Am I fighting a useless battle or do you have some ideas on how I can relate to the entire team to make a shift?</li>
<li><a href="#t=48:57">48:57</a> I have a question about extending WordPress. My client needs a CRM for his non-profit. Would a system built with custom post types and fields get me far enough along this path, or am I better off suggesting he invest in an existing CRM and find some way to integrate it with WordPress?</li>
<li><a href="#t=57:24">57:24</a> My question concerns the registration form for a web app, which I am currently developing. Should I require the user to verify either their email address or their password, or both?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Dan Denney is a front-end dev at Code School and the founder of Front-End Conf.
Dan shared his workflow for sending HTML email, we took a deep dive into Mandrill, discussed our current build processes, how to get a team up to modern development standards, and more.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

23:54 What are you using for your build process when developing?
31:49 I work for a large software company and enjoy my work but, we have weekly meetings discussing non-software things. How can I give feedback about these meetings without sounding like a jerk?
40:20 I just landed a gig as a developer at a local marketing agency. From my understanding they have been using back-end developers to develop the front-end of websites. They also use designers with focus in print to create web designs and tackle usability. The designers and developers alike have been resistant to modern web best practices. The phrase &#8220;pixel perfect&#8221; is often used and it is expected that the final product be a mirror image of the mockup. With experience in UX, mobile, and performance I would like to bring them up to speed in the modern era of web development. Am I fighting a useless battle or do you have some ideas on how I can relate to the entire team to make a shift?
48:57 I have a question about extending WordPress. My client needs a CRM for his non-profit. Would a system built with custom post types and fields get me far enough along this path, or am I better off suggesting he invest in an existing CRM and find some way to integrate it with WordPress?
57:24 My question concerns the registration form for a web app, which I am currently developing. Should I require the user to verify either their email address or their password, or both?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wren Lanier leads design and UX at Highrise.</p>
<p>In this episode, we discuss designing on the Z axis, disruption in the web design industry, responsive design for giant screens, next steps for a junior designer looking to level-up, and more!</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>News’n’Links’n’Drama:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=19:38">19:38</a> <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">Shoptalkshow.com</a> redesign! Fresh! Exciting! It&#8217;ll change your life!</li>
<li><a href="#t=29:29">29:29</a> <a href="https://iojs.org/">io.js</a> reached 1.0</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=30:56">30:56</a> I have noticed that the :visited selector seems to have fallen in usage over the last few years. Do you think styling :visited links is better or worse for accessibility?</li>
<li><a href="#t=37:00">37:00</a> I am in the process of building a mobile first e-commerce website. At the moment my layout cover screens up to 1600px wide with information, for instance when I display the catalogue, a grid three products wide covers most of the screen. Is this too wide, how wide is too wide, what are your thoughts on responsive web design for larger screens?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Wren Lanier leads design and UX at Highrise.
In this episode, we discuss designing on the Z axis, disruption in the web design industry, responsive design for giant screens, next steps for a junior designer looking to level-up, and more!
We talked about (roughly in order):
News’n’Links’n’Drama:

19:38 Shoptalkshow.com redesign! Fresh! Exciting! It&#8217;ll change your life!
29:29 io.js reached 1.0

Q &#38; A:

30:56 I have noticed that the :visited selector seems to have fallen in usage over the last few years. Do you think styling :visited links is better or worse for accessibility?
37:00 I am in the process of building a mobile first e-commerce website. At the moment my layout cover screens up to 1600px wide with information, for instance when I display the catalogue, a grid three products wide covers most of the screen. Is this too wide, how wide is too wide, what are your thoughts on responsive web design for larger screens?
42:25 My question is about billing. I do freelance web development and I&#8217;m starting to gain quite a few clients and recurring billing is becoming more important. In the past I&#8217;ve used a google doc template but feel it looks unprofessional and I&#8217;d like to use a software that stores my clients information. What are your suggestions?
46:57 I wanted to ask about how you guys started in the trade and is there any significant steps (tutorials, languages, workflow improvements) that you would recommend?
51:17 When I specify a text size in CSS, it appears in different sizes on iOS devices (iPhones &#38; iPads). It even appears in different sizes on the same device depending on whether it&#8217;s rotated into portrait or landscape view. Please explain the rules used by iOS devices to shrink or enlarge text. Does &#8220;retina&#8221; resolution play into this?
55:08 I am a front-end developer and have been doing contract work for 2 years. I believe I am ready to apply for a full time in-house dev job. I updated my resume and started looking at job listings. I have noticed listings for UI/UX developers / UI/UX designers and Junior Front-End Developers. What are these jobs like? What is a junior developer salary like? What kind of tools are required for these jobs?

<li><a href="#t=23:00">23:00</a> With the increased popularity of the Grunt task runner, have you guys migrated away from Codekit all together or are you using both Codekit &amp; Grunt simultaneously (or just Codekit)?

<li><a href="#t=30:23">30:23</a> I frequently hear that using display:none to hide elements that only appear at certain breakpoints is bad practice. What&#8217;s the better, preferred method?</li>
<li><a href="#t=33:57">33:57</a> I have a question about responsive websites and SEO. I&#8217;m a WordPress developer and usually I have 2 menus for a responsive website, a main menu for large screens, and a mobile menu. Will I get penalized in SEO for having this second menu?</li>

<li><a href="#t=44:12">44:12</a> What are some good strategies for dealing with tabular data in responsive design?</li>
<li><a href="#t=48:25">48:25</a> Standards pushed us to code more consciously. RWD put the focus on accessibility and performance. What&#8217;s the next big thing?</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="#t=16:24">16:24</a> I&#8217;m not so experienced with JavaScript, so I really don&#8217;t quite understand the potential benefits from using a JavaScript Front End Framework. Could you describe it with your own words and give some examples for real-world use cases?</li>
<li><a href="#t=25:45">25:45</a> I&#8217;m thinking about learning a JavaScript framework. So far I&#8217;ve been recommended to look into Angular and Ember. Which one is better?</li>
<li><a href="#t=58:07">58:07</a> How did you get started in open source software? What&#8217;s the best advice you have for encouraging others to get started as well, namely designers, writers, etc?</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week we&#8217;re joined by Tom Dale. Tom is a former Apple software engineer who worked on MobileMe and iCloud. He also helped create Ember.js and co-founded Tilde.io with Yehuda Katz.
We took a deep dive into Ember.js, JavaScript frameworks, and working with open source projects.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

16:24 I&#8217;m not so experienced with JavaScript, so I really don&#8217;t quite understand the potential benefits from using a JavaScript Front End Framework. Could you describe it with your own words and give some examples for real-world use cases?
25:45 I&#8217;m thinking about learning a JavaScript framework. So far I&#8217;ve been recommended to look into Angular and Ember. Which one is better?
58:07 How did you get started in open source software? What&#8217;s the best advice you have for encouraging others to get started as well, namely designers, writers, etc?

<li><a href="#t=31:56">31:56</a> I work for a company and my main responsibility is taking a PSD and converting it into a fully responsive HTML + CSS template. Would Grunt be an appropriate addition to my workflow or is it geared towards JavaScript projects?</li>

<li><a href="#t=45:38">45:38</a> I&#8217;ve been recently learning more about Meteor, but I&#8217;m wondering what are your thoughts on these frameworks. Do you think they are going to replace front-end javascript frameworks (Angular, Backbone, Ember) + server side framework (Rails, Express, Django) or do you think there&#8217;s a reason this separation exists between front-end and back-end?</li>
<li><a href="#t=56:40">56:40</a> How do jQuery Page Loaders work? How can I utilize CSS animations (even SVG at some point) on a page loader? Can you ask jQuery to paint a progress bar for each % of the website it has loaded? Would that slow down the loading?</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPID-FIRE!!! Nothing but Thanksgiving turkey hangover and hot question and answer madness!</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:12">3:12</a> I have had to do a bunch of horizontal scrolling sliders for work lately. These &#8220;sliders&#8221; always through me for a loop because I am working off comps I had no part in designing. How do I keep these sliders from freaking out when the browser is resized while they are partially scrolled, and what is the definitive best way to make these from a performance and UX stand point so that I can help our designers make better choices?</li>
<li><a href="#t=10:10">10:10</a> When it comes to responsive web design in WordPress, I find myself using a lot of modules in the WordPress page editor to organize the sites content. Is there an easier way of doing this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=16:30">16:30</a> Have you ever used any prototyping tool like Fireworks or Sketch? If so, what is the best tool you&#8217;ve came across?</li>
<li><a href="#t=22:10">22:10</a> Where should I include the media queries for my responsive design in my CSS files?</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:14">30:14</a> Is there a way to use pure CSS (i.e., no JavaScript) to modify properties of a whole table-column without marking up each individual cell?</li>
<li><a href="#t=35:07">35:07</a> What other podcasts do you listen to?</li>
<li><a href="#t=45:30">45:30</a> Why are some sites targeted by hackers more than others, especially automated attacks? Do web sites end up on target lists, or are the attacks just random?</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week it&#8217;s another RAPID-FIRE!!! Nothing but Thanksgiving turkey hangover and hot question and answer madness!
Q &#38; A:

3:12 I have had to do a bunch of horizontal scrolling sliders for work lately. These &#8220;sliders&#8221; always through me for a loop because I am working off comps I had no part in designing. How do I keep these sliders from freaking out when the browser is resized while they are partially scrolled, and what is the definitive best way to make these from a performance and UX stand point so that I can help our designers make better choices?
10:10 When it comes to responsive web design in WordPress, I find myself using a lot of modules in the WordPress page editor to organize the sites content. Is there an easier way of doing this?
16:30 Have you ever used any prototyping tool like Fireworks or Sketch? If so, what is the best tool you&#8217;ve came across?
22:10 Where should I include the media queries for my responsive design in my CSS files?
30:14 Is there a way to use pure CSS (i.e., no JavaScript) to modify properties of a whole table-column without marking up each individual cell?
35:07 What other podcasts do you listen to?
45:30 Why are some sites targeted by hackers more than others, especially automated attacks? Do web sites end up on target lists, or are the attacks just random?

What do you think? Are there other similar solutions you like better?</li>
<li><a href="#t=5:40">5:40</a> I&#8217;m working on a refactor of a site I built a while ago. In that site, I&#8217;m loading a font file just for the logo which seems like it might be unneeded page bloat. My question is: is it worth the time subsetting a font for only the characters I need, or would a better approach be some sort of accessible svg?</li>
<li><a href="#t=11:40">11:40</a> I came across thegrid.io and watched their video. I love the concept, but how do you think this will effect the web design industry?</li>
<li><a href="#t=18:30">18:30</a> Is there a good replacement for css resets?</li>
<li><a href="#t=24:33">24:33</a> I&#8217;m wondering what your experiences are with hacking attempts and what methods you use to secure your sites and servers; specifically for WordPress sites?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:01">38:01</a> I recently started to use SVGs instead of an iconfont. However I&#8217;m still struggling with the right technique. What are your thoughts on that?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:11">44:11</a> I have a situation where people are creating and editing content in Google Docs, then pasting the content over to the CMS. Sometimes Docs behaves and doesn&#8217;t include a bunch of inline styles, sometimes it isn&#8217;t so nice. What is the best/most efficient way to override these inline styles?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:56">51:56</a> Why isn&#8217;t there a good text editor for OS X ? I&#8217;m so tired of these multi-platform editors like Atom, Sublime, and Brackets. Are there any better options?</li>

<li><a href="#t=17:56">17:56</a> Do you know of any standard way that accessibility-aware web devs will test whether their ARIA-related efforts have proven successful? Is there some screen-reader or browser-extension of choice (or just your personal recommendation)?</li>
<li><a href="#t=26:00">26:00</a> Our client&#8217;s accessibility consultant is telling them that they must have valid HTML in order to be WCAG 2.0 compliant. Is that true?</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:46">30:46</a> With the prevalence of front-end frameworks like AngularJS, there seems to be a rise in logging in via AJAX instead of a traditional post back. I&#8217;m all for AJAX in almost every case on a web app, but when it comes to login/logout, I feel the perceived load time is much better for a traditional post back. I haven&#8217;t done any A/B testing on this with real users yet, but I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts!</li>
<li><a href="#t=42:19">42:19</a> My question is concerning aria attributes placed on icon fonts, and the accessibility issues that can arise if you use the wrong one. For the past year or so at the agency I work at, we&#8217;ve been using icon fonts and slapping an aria-hidden=&#8221;true&#8221; on all of them. Recently I learned of the aria-label and aria-labelled by attributes. Dave, since you&#8217;re the accessibility master, what&#8217;s the best and/or proper way to use these different attributes?</li>
<li><a href="#t=54:30">54:30</a> What do you guys think about minifying html?</li>

Warning: this episode contains some spookily-scary soundbytes; listener discretion is advised.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Errors and Omissions

19:22 Blurry text after 3D transform? You need to use only 2D transform or hide, request prop, show. Thanks to Matt Lockyer for clearing that up!
20:12 Here&#8217;s that jQuery plugin for &#8216;responsive cropping&#8217;. Dynamically crop images to fill available space without cutting out the image&#8217;s subject. Great for full-screen images. Thanks to Zsolt Pentz for sharing that!

Q &#38; A:

22:06 How much does A/B Testing help in eCommerce, and which tools or plugins do you use to A/B Test?
34:30 I&#8217;m working with someone on a WordPress site to clean it up and install a new theme. Here&#8217;s the problem: they&#8217;ve got hundreds of posts and pages chock full of inline styling&#8230; and there are so many &#60;span&#62;s! It&#8217;s bad. Please tell me there&#8217;s a good way to strip all the cruft from these posts and pages in bulk!
38:20 I was thinking about managing CSS / JS for WordPress (as you guys were talking about recently), and avoiding extra http requests. This plugin (AutoOptimize) may be worth a look.
41:35 I have a question about Bower and WordPress.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPID-FIRE!!! Nothing but mouth guns and hot question and answer madness!</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=8:16">8:16</a> Is there a reason to use single quotes instead of double quotes when writing HTML?</li>
<li><a href="#t=11:45">11:45</a> I started doing work (with a group of fellow students) for a client 6 months ago, and they keep coming back with more work and changes to the site. I still haven&#8217;t been paid for the original work, and I can&#8217;t keep working for free, but I really need the money (if they ever pay). What should I do?</li>
<li><a href="#t=20:12">20:12</a> I work for an agency that hires a new developer every 9-12 months or so (with 5 currently on staff). Besides resources, what kinds of things can we put in place to not only make that a more seamless transition, but also for us to perform as a more cohesive unit?</li>
<li><a href="#t=26:10">26:10</a> My question is about rendering quality of text when the CSS transform scale is applied to the container. After scale is applied the text looks blurry. I tried using some of the fixes (like text stroke, for example), and it&#8217;s a little better but still not very sharp. Any suggestions?</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week it&#8217;s another RAPID-FIRE!!! Nothing but mouth guns and hot question and answer madness!
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

8:16 Is there a reason to use single quotes instead of double quotes when writing HTML?
11:45 I started doing work (with a group of fellow students) for a client 6 months ago, and they keep coming back with more work and changes to the site. I still haven&#8217;t been paid for the original work, and I can&#8217;t keep working for free, but I really need the money (if they ever pay). What should I do?
20:12 I work for an agency that hires a new developer every 9-12 months or so (with 5 currently on staff). Besides resources, what kinds of things can we put in place to not only make that a more seamless transition, but also for us to perform as a more cohesive unit?
26:10 My question is about rendering quality of text when the CSS transform scale is applied to the container. After scale is applied the text looks blurry. I tried using some of the fixes (like text stroke, for example), and it&#8217;s a little better but still not very sharp. Any suggestions?
36:00 What are the latest developments for dealing with the responsive image &#8220;art direction&#8221; problem?
44:59 How do web designers and developers handle the hosting of their own sites and their clients&#8217; sites without it becoming a logistical nightmare?
51:20 The other day I saw a stack overflow question where somebody posted a PSD of a share button their designer had given them, and asked for someone to make it work using pure CSS. What are your thoughts on the ethics of outsourcing to stackoverflow?

<li><a href="#t=3:26">3:26</a> For responsive menus, do you use a similar plugin on each site, or do you build custom menus for each site? Are there any responsive menu plugins that you would recommend?</li>

<li><a href="#t=17:58">17:58</a> I&#8217;m trying to develop a horizontally-scrolling page layout for a website I&#8217;m working on. How would you guys tackle this sort of challenge these days?</li>
<li><a href="#t=25:11">25:11</a> I&#8217;m curious if you&#8217;ve ever been part of a team where you or someone else on the team introduced a technology or process change or maybe like a paradigm shift in how things needed to be done. What were the toughest challenges?</li>

<li><a href="#t=50:08">50:08</a> I&#8217;ve been implementing AJAX on my Rails 4 site with jquery&#8217;s $.load() function and using window.history.pushState() to update url&#8217;s in the browser&#8217;s address form. I am having issues with the page staying the same when I use the back button. The url responds correctly in the address bar, however the page does not go back to it&#8217;s previous state. I&#8217;ve read about a few javascript libraries being able to deal with this. What are y&#8217;all&#8217;s thoughts on the subject?</li>
<li><a href="#t=56:29">56:29</a> We&#8217;re considering moving a WordPress site with a few hundred posts, and growing, over to a static site generator like Jekyll. I&#8217;m wondering, how scalable is it? Is there a limit? Do things slow down?</li>

50:08 I&#8217;ve been implementing AJAX on my Rails 4 site with jquery&#8217;s $.load() function and using window.history.pushState() to update url&#8217;s in the browser&#8217;s address form. I am having issues with the page staying the same when I use the back button. The url responds correctly in the address bar, however the page does not go back to it&#8217;s previous state. I&#8217;ve read about a few javascript libraries being able to deal with this. What are y&#8217;all&#8217;s thoughts on the subject?
56:29 We&#8217;re considering moving a WordPress site with a few hundred posts, and growing, over to a static site generator like Jekyll. I&#8217;m wondering, how scalable is it? Is there a limit? Do things slow down?

<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:08">3:08</a> I hear a lot of people asking about mentorships so I made a site called HackMentor for people to post looking for mentors / mentees. I wanted to learn MVC so I thought it would be a fun project to get the concepts down.</li>
<li><a href="#t=5:03">5:03</a> I use Sass and Compass with Singularity and Breakpoint. I&#8217;ve been looking into integrating Grunt into my workflow but I&#8217;m having trouble finding a good solution to managing the Sass / Compass gems / plugins and the NPM dependencies. It feels like wonky to use bundler and npm, my project has a lot of configuration files it. Is there a better solution?</li>
<li><a href="#t=13:28">13:28</a> Just listened to episode 115 and Codekit looks like an amazing application. I have a question about using it in a Rails project. I think I recall Chris saying that he uses it when working with Rails. Can you explain the workflow for that?</li>
<li><a href="#t=15:20">15:20</a> Since the advent of tablets &amp; smartphones I&#8217;ve noticed that my clients are a lot less concerned about desktop legacy issues i.e. IE. Should designers be a lot more emboldened in advising their clients to ditch IE 6-9 &amp; get them to spend their money &amp; your time on tablet-y smartphone-y goodness?</li>
<li><a href="#t=21:30">21:30</a> I&#8217;m having trouble with setting up Codekit to work with a Drupal Foundation 5 setup. Any advice?</li>
<li><a href="#t=28:36">28:36</a> What is a good way to implement page navigation with following requirements: no page refresh, the pages asynchronously preload, so there&#8217;s not much waiting when navigating, flexibility around loading new pages (for example the new page slides in rather than suddenly replacing the current one). Is Backbone good for this stuff or do I need something more advanced?</li>
<li><a href="#t=36:51">36:51</a> I just started working from home and I&#8217;m searching for some tips about how to setup my workspace. What kind of monitor are you using for coding? Are you using multiple monitors? Are you using an extra ergonomic keyboard/mouse? Do you guys like a standing desk? What kind of chair are you using?</li>
<li><a href="#t=48:27">48:27</a> My websites are getting more and more heavy with images and animations and my bosses / clients are complaining that things are taking to long to load and is not very responsive to user interaction. What are your suggestions on how to get my page to load sections at a time or load everything while displaying a loading animation?</li>

News’n’Links’n’Drama:

12:00 Don&#8217;t call it Standard Markdown

Q &#38; A:

16:07 How do you prefer attaching JavaScript events to elements?
25:58 I am having a hard time finding a way to bridge my methods between front-end javascript and back-end php/mysql. Is there a good way to bridge these technologies?
32:36 Is there a foundry or type designer you rely on to provide consistency, or do you assume the well known ones are all pretty much the same quality? Is there a real incentive to hosting yourself?
44:04 Is there a &#8216;best-practices&#8217; way to direct WordPress to run any CSS and JS from plugins in the footer?
53:10 I have a friend that wants to make a quick buck throwing together sites with Drupal themes. How do you both precisely articulate what is, and what is not “professional” practice?

<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:29">3:29</a> My question is about LiveReload. I want to use this but am having trouble getting sass, wordpress, and LiveReload to play nicely. When setting up live reload do you use the JS snippet or the chrome extension? Do you let LiveReload compile your sass, or use your tool of choice?</li>

<li><a href="#t=20:18">20:18</a> How does one bounce back from a bad job interview?</li>
<li><a href="#t=24:44">24:44</a> There is a growing trend now to switch from Photoshop to Sketch. I have been working in a Windows environment all this time and I have no idea what to do if I got a Sketch document! Should I ask the designers to extract the assets to me and use a JPG as a reference? Should I turn down jobs I am getting that aren&#8217;t in Photoshop till Sketch releases a version that can run in Windows?</li>
<li><a href="#t=33:21">33:21</a> What are your thoughts on the single responsibility principle pertaining to classes in html/css? If you use this principle, do you extend many classes in sass?</li>
<li><a href="#t=42:42">42:42</a> I have seen examples (Chris even did one on css-tricks.com) where you can have audio playing even after changing pages. Is it possible to do this with video in the sidebar?</li>
<li><a href="#t=48:23">48:23</a> What is the best way to query for the span element above using javascript?</li>
<li><a href="#t=55:05">55:05</a> I&#8217;m looking at switching my line-height set up from rem width px fallback to unitless. This is for a responsive project, where the support benchmarks have been set pretty far back. What the benefits are compered to staying with rems, and is there a performance/rendering benefit, or does unitless help with responsive?</li>

They claim the CSS it delivers for the client is too messy, and that we should write straight CSS. Do you have any recommendations for writing cleaner pre-processed code?</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:15">47:15</a> Is it feasible in CSS to have ellipsis applied to multiline text (text in a block, so height is also should be considered), if it starts to overflow?</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week we were joined by Karolina Szczur. Karolina is a designer, developer and photographer living in Kraków, Poland. She is currently working with the delightful people of &#38;yet.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

23:44 How do you guys deal with web fonts that render significantly smaller than average?
31:02 What is the current trend for the placement of a form on a page?
39:46 The agency I work with isn&#8217;t happy I&#8217;m using LESS or SASS for front end styles. They claim the CSS it delivers for the client is too messy, and that we should write straight CSS. Do you have any recommendations for writing cleaner pre-processed code?
47:15 Is it feasible in CSS to have ellipsis applied to multiline text (text in a block, so height is also should be considered), if it starts to overflow?
58:11 I am quite new to web design and I think I could improve on my web presence. It seems that almost all web professionals use Twitter extensively. Why is it such an important tool?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE! Nothing but the best darn question and answer action you&#8217;ve ever heard!</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:45">3:45</a> I need a responsive image solution for a redesign of a website running on the (.NET) Episerver CMS. What responsive image solution would you use under these constraints?</li>
<li><a href="#t=8:18">8:18</a> I&#8217;ve built a whole range of different sites now on WordPress and in each case I&#8217;ve felt that once I push the site live, the load time is sluggish. How do you approach this problem and what kinds of resources are out there to help?</li>
<li><a href="#t=13:50">13:50</a> Any tips for avoiding merge conflicts in the compiled .css file when working in teams? Should I even push compiled CSS to the repository, or should this be one person&#8217;s responsibility?</li>
<li><a href="#t=17:13">17:13</a> What software do you guys recommend when testing websites through a screen reader or text-based browser?</li>
<li><a href="#t=23:11">23:11</a> I&#8217;ve seen a few tutorials online using Adobe Edge Animate to create CSS animations. Is it something that needs to be learned or looked into if I already have working knowledge of CSS3 animations and transforms?</li>
<li><a href="#t=28:15">28:15</a> I am trying to dig into Sass/SCSS, preprocessors and have learned a lot already about using command line with Grunt.js and Compass, but I&#8217;m wondering if CodeKit would just be a simpler and easier thing to learn first?</li>
<li><a href="#t=32:10">32:10</a> What are some best practices when using <code>tabindex</code>?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:06">38:06</a> Where would you recommend a young web designer start off? Let&#8217;s say they know html and css and are looking to learn more or kick of their career, what would you recommend?</li>
<li><a href="#t=41:10">41:10</a> I know there is a performance hit for every new font that gets loaded, but once I have loaded a font, is there a performance hit based on how much text on the page is being rendered? My boss likes to use the web font for the H tags and then use fallback web safe fonts for body copy, is this necessary?</li>
<li><a href="#t=45:05">45:05</a> I used to use my main email address for all my accounts, and shortly after an attack on a certain famous tech company, I received huge waves of spam that I have been struggling to get rid of. How do you guys handle your email accounts?</li>
<li><a href="#t=49:08">49:08</a> I&#8217;ve got a bone to pick with links and a seemingly odd trend of not adding <code>target="_blank"</code>. My question to you is, &#8220;What&#8217;s up with that?&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="#t=54:00">54:00</a> If you export an adobe illustrator AI file to SVG, you can choose to save the layers as meta data in the SVG file. What&#8217;s even more interesting is you can then target those layers with css and jquery. Essentially you can traverse the Illustrator layer stack in an SVG file and add things like hover events which change the layer color via css. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://skillzdesign.com/blog/clarifies/building-an-interactive-floor-plan-with-svg-jquery-json-and-wordpress/">tutorial on the subject</a> which goes into greater detail.</li>

Q &#38; A:

2:01 I follow tons of awesome web developers on Twitter and I learn about all the cool new things. I&#8217;m feeling a little overwhelmed. How do I actually get better at making websites?
8:22 I got an email that contained a countdown timer gif. Do you know how this was accomplished?
15:54 I am working with a site that generates it&#8217;s own short urls and I was wondering about adding to my pages. First of all, what good does it do? Secondly, I also saw . What is the difference, if any, and which should I be using?
25:44 What is your preference for fixing design breakpoints in responsive designs?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week it&#8217;s another Rapid Fire!!! Nothing but the best darn question and answer action you&#8217;ve ever heard!</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:30">3:30</a> Do you have any rule of thumb for deciding when to use the new element (using the picturefill polyfill) vs just using CSS background images with media queries for responsive images? Is it more a question of semantics?</li>
<li><a href="#t=12:15">12:15</a> What is translateZ traditionally used for and how can it help me with my front-end style markup?</li>
<li><a href="#t=24:26">24:26</a> I love inline-block, it&#8217;s great and allows for easy simple vertical alignment. However it always adds that little bit of extras space making items wrap, e.g. a list of 4 with each set at 25%. Is there a better/cleaner way than commenting out the space? Why does it even happen?
<li><a href="#t=31:36">31:36</a> I&#8217;m trying to move stackicons.com from icon font to SVG-based. Can you reference an external style sheet in the SVG file itself and use that as a single place to change styling across all the icons?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:45">38:45</a> In jQuery, what is the difference between the .on function and the .click function?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:47">44:47</a> I&#8217;m curious on what your thoughts are for terminology changes across an entire project. To give you some background, I work for a company that has created a web-based software. We have come across stages in our development that we want to change the terminology for functionality in our site. How would you guys go about this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:44">51:44</a> Regarding performance on mobile, is it better to A) have all content on page load and then show-hide it, B) inject the markup and content dynamically or C) load that markup and content using ajax, when a tablet o desktop media query matches, so secondary content can be shown to these more capable browsers.</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week it&#8217;s another Rapid Fire!!! Nothing but the best darn question and answer action you&#8217;ve ever heard!
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

3:30 Do you have any rule of thumb for deciding when to use the new element (using the picturefill polyfill) vs just using CSS background images with media queries for responsive images? Is it more a question of semantics?
12:15 What is translateZ traditionally used for and how can it help me with my front-end style markup?
24:26 I love inline-block, it&#8217;s great and allows for easy simple vertical alignment. However it always adds that little bit of extras space making items wrap, e.g. a list of 4 with each set at 25%. Is there a better/cleaner way than commenting out the space? Why does it even happen?
31:36 I&#8217;m trying to move stackicons.com from icon font to SVG-based. Can you reference an external style sheet in the SVG file itself and use that as a single place to change styling across all the icons?
38:45 In jQuery, what is the difference between the .on function and the .click function?
44:47 I&#8217;m curious on what your thoughts are for terminology changes across an entire project. To give you some background, I work for a company that has created a web-based software. We have come across stages in our development that we want to change the terminology for functionality in our site. How would you guys go about this?
51:44 Regarding performance on mobile, is it better to A) have all content on page load and then show-hide it, B) inject the markup and content dynamically or C) load that markup and content using ajax, when a tablet o desktop media query matches, so secondary content can be shown to these more capable browsers.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we were joined by <a href="http://kovalc.in/">Katie Kovalcin</a>. Katie is a designer at Happy Cog in Austin and teaches at Girl Develop It.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>News’n’Links’n’Drama:</p>
<p><a href="#t=12:55">12:55</a> <a href="http://missionlocal.org/2014/06/live-blog-google-io-protest/">Protesters outside Google.io</a>, and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/26/5846216/other-companies-are-already-selling-google-cardboard-clones">Google Cardboard</a></p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=19:56">19:56</a> What is your feeling on website creators like Wix and Squarespace? Is this taking away from potential business for web designer/developers?</li>
<li><a href="#t=27:32">27:32</a> Recently I was asked to create page design for a client. Just the visual design, no code. I thought this would be easy, but after spending an hour and a half creating a table in Illustrator, I&#8217;m yearning for some basic HTML &amp; CSS. Are there any design tools you guys know of that take into account of things like &#8220;separation of style and content&#8221; or &#8220;modular components&#8221;?</li>
<li><a href="#t=34:10">34:10</a> I&#8217;m a newb. I love designing using HTML and CSS, but my creativity is stunted because I can&#8217;t program. Which language should I learn first?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:43">38:43</a> Responsive web design has done a lot of great things for the web, but sometimes the sharing of a single codebase for all the different breakpoints makes things tricky. I&#8217;ll usually ask my designers to avoid situations that would require building a component in two different ways across screen sizes. The navigation in the header is usually one of the areas for this discussion (where a design basically requires toggling visibility between two different menu systems). Am I being too much of a stickler or should I stand my ground?</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:03">47:03</a> For smaller websites I often find it difficult to collect quality content from the business that I am designing a website for. These website budgets are usually small therefore a content writer may not be practical. Can you explain your process on collecting data or steering customers in the right direction when it comes to providing quality content?</li>
<li><a href="#t=52:35">52:35</a> I&#8217;ve got this really bad habit of nudging things in my design. Two pixels up, an em here, an em there. And then repeat into insanity. I&#8217;m always struggling to get that whitespace just right. How do you approach whitespace?</li>

Q &#38; A:

19:56 What is your feeling on website creators like Wix and Squarespace? Is this taking away from potential business for web designer/developers?
27:32 Recently I was asked to create page design for a client. Just the visual design, no code.

These website budgets are usually small therefore a content writer may not be practical. Can you explain your process on collecting data or steering customers in the right direction when it comes to providing quality content?

<li><a href="#t=32:20">32:20</a> I created a website with a small app for a client, and now they want the source code for the app so another developer can work on it. What should I do?</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPID-FIRE!!! Nothing but the best darn question and answer you&#8217;ve ever heard!</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=1:28">1:28</a> How can I achieve HTML includes or imports without using any php or javascript? I know that Codekit has a Kit language that can do this but I don&#8217;t have a mac yet. Is there a HTML preprocessors that can do this? If so, can I use only the import function and still use regular HTML on it?</li>
<li><a href="#t=8:56">8:56</a> Picture this: Client organization has a CMS and puts all their ‘news’ content in. Monthly they need to generate a paper newsletter… They push ONE BUTTON and a multi-page pdf, at least as beautiful as the site, is generated with all of their news content… Has anyone tried this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=17:03">17:03</a> What&#8217;s the best way to compress a vector graphic from Illustrator for the web? There used to be a SVG option for &#8220;Save for Web and Devices&#8221; but it&#8217;s gone in CS6. What SVG specs are best to use?</li>
<li><a href="#t=22:43">22:43</a> I&#8217;m starting to hear the phrase &#8220;Tech Bubble&#8221; a lot and it&#8217;s very disheartening. Do you guys believe we&#8217;re in a tech bubble? If so, is it we the web developers/designers who have to worry? Or is it more threatening to investors, entrepreneurs, and 30 y/o billionaires? </li>
<li><a href="#t=32:30">32:30</a> I&#8217;m about to start working at a full time job where the team uses Git. Do you have any advice about workflow or etiquette?</li>
<li><a href="#t=39:34">39:34</a> I&#8217;m a developer at a mid-sized SaaS company and we have a pretty successful product. Our product has an API and there are several other companies that sell web site integrations &amp; 3rd party plugins to our customers. Our company even receives fees to recommend certain &#8220;preferred partners&#8221;. Do you think it would be unethical or a conflict of interest for me to develop my own premium WordPress plugin on my own time?</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:47">47:47</a> I&#8217;m currently working in a project and the design calls for use of full-screen image backgrounds, in order to optimize this for mobile devices I&#8217;m using media queries to call the appropriate background, it works like a charm, however there is something that bothers me, if I resize the window there&#8217;s a small bit of time where the webpage has no background while the image get&#8217;s loaded. Any way around this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:51">51:51</a> Why aren&#8217;t box-shadow and text-shadow shorthand properties like background and font? Why don&#8217;t the properties box-shadow-color, box-shadow-offset, etc. exist?</li>
<li><a href="#t=58:09">58:09</a> My question is about Print Stylesheets. Are they still relevant? How do you approach them?</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week it&#8217;s another RAPID-FIRE!!! Nothing but the best darn question and answer you&#8217;ve ever heard!
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

1:28 How can I achieve HTML includes or imports without using any php or javascript? I know that Codekit has a Kit language that can do this but I don&#8217;t have a mac yet. Is there a HTML preprocessors that can do this? If so, can I use only the import function and still use regular HTML on it?
8:56 Picture this: Client organization has a CMS and puts all their ‘news’ content in. Monthly they need to generate a paper newsletter… They push ONE BUTTON and a multi-page pdf, at least as beautiful as the site, is generated with all of their news content… Has anyone tried this?
17:03 What&#8217;s the best way to compress a vector graphic from Illustrator for the web? There used to be a SVG option for &#8220;Save for Web and Devices&#8221; but it&#8217;s gone in CS6. What SVG specs are best to use?
22:43 I&#8217;m starting to hear the phrase &#8220;Tech Bubble&#8221; a lot and it&#8217;s very disheartening. Do you guys believe we&#8217;re in a tech bubble? If so, is it we the web developers/designers who have to worry? Or is it more threatening to investors, entrepreneurs, and 30 y/o billionaires? 
32:30 I&#8217;m about to start working at a full time job where the team uses Git. Do you have any advice about workflow or etiquette?
39:34 I&#8217;m a developer at a mid-sized SaaS company and we have a pretty successful product. Our product has an API and there are several other companies that sell web site integrations &#38; 3rd party plugins to our customers. Our company even receives fees to recommend certain &#8220;preferred partners&#8221;. Do you think it would be unethical or a conflict of interest for me to develop my own premium WordPress plugin on my own time?
47:47 I&#8217;m currently working in a project and the design calls for use of full-screen image backgrounds, in order to optimize this for mobile devices I&#8217;m using media queries to call the appropriate background, it works like a charm, however there is something that bothers me, if I resize the window there&#8217;s a small bit of time where the webpage has no background while the image get&#8217;s loaded. Any way around this?
51:51 Why aren&#8217;t box-shadow and text-shadow shorthand properties like background and font? Why don&#8217;t the properties box-shadow-color, box-shadow-offset, etc. exist?
58:09 My question is about Print Stylesheets. Are they still relevant? How do you approach them?

		<itunes:summary>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE!!! Nothing but HOT question &#38; answer action.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

2:25 With this trend of big background images and full with slider, which size of images do you recommend to have a balance between size and weight? 
7:56 What&#8217;s the best way to handle SVGs?
23:37 Why don&#8217;t browsers just include various versions of jquery within the end user machine, loading it as they encounter usage?
27:36 You&#8217;ve mentioned Harvest as a tool for time-tracking and invoicing; are there any other tools you would suggest, specifically for expense tracking?
36:36 What do all of you think of Netflix disabling the developer console in Chrome? Will this become popular in the future? Is it unethical?
40:35 Inline-block grid systems won&#8217;t render correctly in Safari 7. It works fine on Safari 6, ffox and Chrome but fails miserably on Safari 7. Any solutions or advice?
43:50 I have recently started to do some freelance web design, I am confident in my pricing however when writing up emails to a potential client giving them an estimate I feel that there is room for improvement. How does Dave/Paravel approach this, do you send some kind of template or something else?
49:25 Going back to something raised in podcast #103 about getting server-side variables into javascript, what is the most pure way of putting server-side data into javascript?
54:37 I&#8217;m curious how you manage passwords when working with clients. How do you securely send passwords to clients?
59:19 I&#8217;m in my 40&#8217;s and to be honest, agencies are looking for people on their 20&#8217;s. Is this web design world a place for only youngsters?

<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=1:53">1:53</a> How do I integrate GitHub into a real web publishing workflow? </li>
<li><a href="#t=6:40">6:40</a> I find typography on the web always looks somehow chunky. That&#8217;s why I use the webkit prefixed font-smoothing: antialiased on every project I work on to make it look nice and crisp at least for some users. Is there a major problem with this feature that I&#8217;ve missed or any other good reason why developers don&#8217;t or shouldn&#8217;t use it? </li>
<li><a href="#t=12:15">12:15</a> I&#8217;ve been messing around with the new Flexslider 2 Beta, and I wanted to pull photos from Flickr and use it as a responsive photo gallery. However, the layout breaks and has excessive white space when Flexslider tries to account for portrait oriented images. Is there a way to use intrinsic ratios like with FitVids to get rid of the excess white space? </li>
<li><a href="#t=18:30">18:30</a> It seems like with responsive design it&#8217;s becoming acceptable to use &#8220;foreground images&#8221; (images IN the markup) as banner images so that they can be scaled down as the viewport narrows. Is this acceptable now? </li>
<li><a href="#t=22:15">22:15</a> If you use media queries to adjust the body font-size percentage, is there any rule to figuring out the adjustments to the percentage as you go along? </li>

<li><a href="#t=29:40">30:51</a> Do you know any good javascript techniques to create pdf files? </li>
<li><a href="#t=31:54">33:00</a> Why SCSS over LESS? </li>
<li><a href="#t=35:36">36:42</a> What do you guys think about the difference between a self taught web designer and a designer with a degree? </li>
<li><a href="#t=38:13">39:23</a> What are your thoughts about working for clients vs working on products? </li>

However, the layout breaks and has excessive white space when Flexslider tries to account for portrait oriented images. Is there a way to use intrinsic ratios like with FitVids to get rid of the excess white space? 
18:30 It seems like with responsive design it&#8217;s becoming acceptable to use &#8220;foreground images&#8221; (images IN the markup) as banner images so that they can be scaled down as the viewport narrows. Is this acceptable now? 
22:15 If you use media queries to adjust the body font-size percentage, is there any rule to figuring out the adjustments to the percentage as you go along? 
26:24 What do you guys use for Style Guide Generation? 
29:00 Do you guys wear pants while recording Shoptalk shows? 
29:49 Any thoughts on Condoleezza Rice joining Dropbox? 
30:51 Do you know any good javascript techniques to create pdf files? 
33:00 Why SCSS over LESS? 
36:42 What do you guys think about the difference between a self taught web designer and a designer with a degree? 
39:23 What are your thoughts about working for clients vs working on products? 
44:07 Do you have any tips about using Codekit and MAMP for local WordPress development?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>His fake name is &#8220;Earl Drudge&#8221;, an anagram of &#8220;Drug Dealer&#8221;. In early March 2014, he used some social engineering techniques and fake US federal documents to be granted full access to Chris&#8217; servers. After missing the opportunity and a failed retaliation attempt, he posted sensitive personal information of Chris&#8217; onto a site where not only can it never be removed, if it&#8217;s attempted to be removed becomes promoted.</p>
<p>He agreed to talk with Chris directly and have it recorded for this show.</p>
<p>We realize that this crosses the line of &#8220;feeding the trolls&#8221; or giving attention to &#8220;bad guys&#8221;, but we feel it relevant for our industry. Our lives and work are completely online and we&#8217;re all highly susceptible to types of hacks and identity theft. It should go without saying that you should not try to be a hero here: if you visit EarlDrudge&#8217;s site(s), try to expose his identity, or try to snoop around on him, you might actually put yourself in a position where you yourself might be vulnerable to being attacked. We advise you to simply listen.</p>
<p><strong>Update since the recording (from Chris)</strong>: I was able to talk with Media Temple directly only hours after this conversation. One good end result is that they have changed their policy of how/when/what documents can be approved in which to grant access and who can do that. The retaliation attempt (&#8220;honeypot&#8221;) was verified to have been done by Media Temple. They were trying to catch the bad guy for me, and while I wish there was better communication about that, it&#8217;s nice to know they were trying to fight back on my behalf.</p>

However, if the property is set by another selector (even a less specific one), it&#8217;s replaced. What&#8217;s the deal? </li>

<li><a href="#t=40:05">40:05</a> I am considering getting into some collaborative development through Github. Is Github&#8217;s Explore the best place to start to find projects, or would you recommend another site for finding projects? </li>

		<itunes:summary>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE!!! Nothing but HOT question &#38; answer action!
Q &#38; A:

10:00 If a freelance client wants an eCommerce solution, what is the best way to handle this? 
17:15 If I set the font-weight on a parent element that doesn&#8217;t generally support text nodes (like TR or UL tags) the property can be inherited by the child TD or LI. However, if the property is set by another selector (even a less specific one), it&#8217;s replaced. What&#8217;s the deal? 
26:09 How you organize variables for preprocessors? 
32:30 I wanted to get your method of tackling web projects. What kind of planning goes into your personal processes? 
40:05 I am considering getting into some collaborative development through Github. Is Github&#8217;s Explore the best place to start to find projects, or would you recommend another site for finding projects? 
48:36 Is it semantically accurate to place pagination or breadcrumbs inside a nav element? 
51:55 Is it a good idea to wrap function calls, which trigger Layout (consecutive read-&#62;write), in request animation frame? 
56:28 I was wondering if you guys could talk about using ajax requests to dynamically load content on a page, and how it can be done so that google can recognize it?

<li><a href="#t=55:00">55:00</a> Why has the html email section of the web not been talked about in the web standards?

		<itunes:summary>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE! We take listener questions and try to answer them as best we can within a 3 minute time constraint.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

2:19 What&#8217;s the best way to release a tiny JQuery plugin?
6:14 My question is about Grunt and requireJS: if I concatenate all my javascript features into a single file, all of them will be loaded with 1 http request, right? So what&#8217;s the point of using requireJS?
13:52 What is the maximum number of javascript files that you should load on the same page?
21:02 I want to set a performance budget but have no idea where to start. Are there any good articles or pieces of advice you can give?
29:00 What&#8217;s the best way to learn JQuery?
31:35 What&#8217;s the best way to detect if something is visible in the browser&#8217;s active viewport?
38:29 Do you know of a port of Bootstrap that is more intended for a Grunt and Sass workflow?
41:50 I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out the right way to handle content hiding. Any advice or thoughts on this?
48:20 How do you handle a boss that gets upset when you ask him about which devices we&#8217;ll be supporting for a project?
51:20 Do you guys know of any cool sites/tools to see what percentage of people are currently using what browsers to get a general idea of global usage on a particular browser version?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE!!! We take listener questions and try to answer them as best we can within a 3 minute time constraint.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:07">3:07</a> HTML email is super fun to design for, so I&#8217;m a little surprised that you guys aren&#8217;t all about it, and kinda put it down in show 12. The demographic I design for love their email and I&#8217;m sure they will until they retire (obviously older crowd, but still relevant).</li>
<li><a href="#t=6:39">6:39</a> How do you know when to scale up and get bigger clients and start charging more? Do I need to look like an agency? Do I need a team?</li>
<li><a href="#t=9:52">9:52</a> In my mind, CMS&#8217;s are too often an annoying, unnecessary layer between the developer/designer and the code, making it harder instead of easier to optimize and maintain. What are some good alternatives for sites that aren&#8217;t e-commerce or blogs?</li>
<li><a href="#t=16:08">16:08</a> Flexible grid vs multiple fixed width layouts. Pros, cons, love, hate?</li>
<li><a href="#t=21:05">21:05</a> Do you think there will ever come a day when the browser makers agree to standardize so we could not have to worry about putting all the browser prefixes in, then for IE, change how we write it completely? Also if this day ever came, how big would the party be?</li>
<li><a href="#t=25:17">25:17</a> My questions are: 1. Is Code Ignitor a good solution for learning the proper PHP way to import images and data from external sources? 2. What&#8217;s the best way to do this without dozens of server requests for each site view? 3. I&#8217;m planning on just reformatting the data with CSS. I want to make compelling infographics from the data. Recommendations?</li>
<li><a href="#t=32:37">32:37</a> Are there any really good introductions out there to CSS preprocessors? </li>
<li><a href="#t=36:28">36:28</a> How do you work with Boilerplate?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:34">40:34</a> Now that Retina is officially coming to the laptop experience, I&#8217;m bracing myself for dealing with having to output design and development mockups at twice the resolution. How do you guys streamline production when taking differing <em>scale</em> resolutions?</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:02">47:02</a> Which responsive grid system do you prefer?</li>
<li><a href="#t=50:07">50:07</a> How do you center a responsive website?</li>
<li><a href="#t=55:17">55:17</a> What effect is the template market having on young developers who are trying to go it alone? Is it lowering client cost expectations but raising their deliverable requirement?</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE!!! We take listener questions and try to answer them as best we can within a 3 minute time constraint.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

3:07 HTML email is super fun to design for, so I&#8217;m a little surprised that you guys aren&#8217;t all about it, and kinda put it down in show 12. The demographic I design for love their email and I&#8217;m sure they will until they retire (obviously older crowd, but still relevant).
6:39 How do you know when to scale up and get bigger clients and start charging more? Do I need to look like an agency? Do I need a team?
9:52 In my mind, CMS&#8217;s are too often an annoying, unnecessary layer between the developer/designer and the code, making it harder instead of easier to optimize and maintain. What are some good alternatives for sites that aren&#8217;t e-commerce or blogs?
16:08 Flexible grid vs multiple fixed width layouts. Pros, cons, love, hate?
21:05 Do you think there will ever come a day when the browser makers agree to standardize so we could not have to worry about putting all the browser prefixes in, then for IE, change how we write it completely? Also if this day ever came, how big would the party be?
25:17 My questions are: 1. Is Code Ignitor a good solution for learning the proper PHP way to import images and data from external sources? 2. What&#8217;s the best way to do this without dozens of server requests for each site view? 3. I&#8217;m planning on just reformatting the data with CSS. I want to make compelling infographics from the data. Recommendations?
32:37 Are there any really good introductions out there to CSS preprocessors? 
36:28 How do you work with Boilerplate?
40:34 Now that Retina is officially coming to the laptop experience, I&#8217;m bracing myself for dealing with having to output design and development mockups at twice the resolution. How do you guys streamline production when taking differing scale resolutions?
47:02 Which responsive grid system do you prefer?
50:07 How do you center a responsive website?
55:17 What effect is the template market having on young developers who are trying to go it alone? Is it lowering client cost expectations but raising their deliverable requirement?

<li><a href="#t=40:05">40:05</a> Is it possible to (and how can one) avoid code redundancy / DRY violations when supporting non-media query browsers like IE8 and below during responsive design implementation?</li>

We talked about (roughly in order):
News’n’Links’n’Drama:

12:33 Web Standards Killed The HTML Star, and Is Web Design Dead?
21:40 Grunt is dead? What about Gulp?

Q &#38; A:

27:04 I&#8217;m curious to know how we as a community are handling touch events on mobile devices at the moment? Specifically referring to dropdown/fly-out menus. Is there a popular jQuery/JS library you&#8217;d recommend?
35:15 Every now and then, my job requires me to code an html email template. I usually have to look online to see what email clients can and can&#8217;t handle, but lately I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of contradictory answers. Is there a CanIUse.com for emails?
40:05 Is it possible to (and how can one) avoid code redundancy / DRY violations when supporting non-media query browsers like IE8 and below during responsive design implementation?
50:37 Can you explain a bit about what Compass is, how to use it, and what makes it so great?
58:34 What are the benefits of having a responsive design vs a separate mobile site?

		<itunes:summary>This week we were joined by Emily Dunkle. Emily is a UI &#38; UX Designer from Massachusetts. She believes in semantic markup, design of all kinds, and a good old-fashioned legal pad.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

16:37 My company&#8217;s IT department has taken over our website. What can I do about it?
25:03 Just wondered what approach you guys take to testing your sites. Not just design, but also functionality and calculations etc. Do you write tests or use any nice tools?
32:55 Will Macaw (and similar tools) replace web designers?
42:40 I have been a web developer for 4 years and I recently built a site for a client that is by far the worst I have built in my career. Should I intentionally ignore best practices just because the client doesn&#8217;t understand and wants the web to work like it did in 2001? 
51:00 I would like to get your opinion and thoughts on how to better interact with other developers who either don&#8217;t care or don&#8217;t have an understanding for why and how you have laid out your markup the way you have.
57:05 What is the best responsive solution for image/video galleries? I need my work to be easily accessible on mobile. My problem is that most websites use lightboxes and this seems outdated now. What are your opinions?

2:27 Do you guys have any advice when the time comes to hand over a WordPress site?
5:57 What are your opinions about disabilities (hopefully about stuttering but not necessary) in the workplace?
9:06 How do I address responsiveness on items that don&#8217;t scale well (table, video embeds)?
14:15 What is Grunt.js? What do I use it for?
17:37 I was wondering what your opinions are on training from places like MakerSquare (in Austin), G-School (in Denver) and others that say they can teach you to become a developer in a relatively short amount of time. Would you consider attending schools like these?
21:14 I&#8217;m looking to start a video blog and I&#8217;m searching for a CMS to use with my static site which I designed and developed. Do you have any experience or thoughts about Leaf CMS?
25:17 Lately I&#8217;ve just been frustrated with all the work needed to make WordPress speedy. The Admin Dashboard in particular can be so slow at times. Any hot tips to make WordPress snappy?
28:35 So we&#8217;ve just launched a startup, what&#8217;s the best way for us to get the app / platform out there, and get people using it?
34:28 I am yet a CSE undergrad student. I like both C++ and CSS. I like native programming and front end programming. Will I have to choose one or can I do both? 
37:56 What are your opinions about Oracle ADF?
42:00 Does it make sense to use sprites in your workflow when your image folder is broken up into 2 or more sub folders?
44:40 Could you talk a bit about Custom Elements (web components) and why they are (or aren&#8217;t) a good idea? Won&#8217;t they dilute the semantic value of already existing elements such as &#60;header&#62; and &#60;footer&#62;?
48:20 Have you investigated switching your local development to AMPPS? I know you have been a big MAMP Pro fan, but I&#8217;ve been reading that it&#8217;s stale and AMPPS has a lot of activity. Thoughts?

17:20 Learn jQuery from Scratch (CSS-Tricks Class)

Q &#38; A:

21:15 Is it worth taking the time to learn Flash in 2013?
26:56 Is getting a degree from a university something that you feel is a necessity for our line of work or is there enough value in self teaching the skills used in web development?
33:54 Can you give a general overview of the things someone new to the field should study right away to build their core coding skills?
39:57 StackOverflow and books can only teach me so much. What are your recommendations for code mentoring both at work and when I freelance? I never know if I am doing things the &#8220;right&#8221; way.
48:32 As someone just starting out in web design, should I be using Flexbox right now?
52:23 I&#8217;ve been designing and developing for a couple years and just moved into WordPress. I stumbled upon the editor that allows you to edit the templates and CSS and I wonder if its a good idea to do edits here or continue to edit the files from the FTP?
56:12 I don&#8217;t do any coding, I solely focus on web design. Can I use a robust, well-maintained Behance/Dribble profile instead of building a separate portfolio site? Will potential employers look down on me if I decide to go in that direction?

News’n’Links’n’Drama:

24:08 Front End Architechture Showdown CSS Cargo Cult
25:19 Does our Industry have a Drinking Problem?
29:34 Scroll Hijacking 

Q &#38; A:

34:56 Why does no one talk about RWD in the opposite direction, making things bigger for larger screens?
40:50 Have you really heard Google say they&#8217;ll punish non-mobile-optimized sites?
48:04 I work for a small traditional advertising and marketing agency. We are often finding that clients are not fully understanding our project proposals and specs from the wireframes and spec we present. Some approve the wireframes then want to change core functionality or design features after development has started. Any advice on how to handle this?
53:00 What is your opinion on websites that use large sliders on the landing page? Do you feel this is a waste of website real estate or a powerful instrument to convey a idea?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s time for another RAPIDFIRE! No news, no drama, just lots of question and answer action.</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=0:51">0:51</a> How do you prefer ordering your queries within your stylesheet? Is mobile-first really the best strategy here?</li>
<li><a href="#t=8:27">8:27</a> Would either of you have any insights as to how to test, target, and develop for the stock &#8220;Internet&#8221; browser app from Android?</li>
<li><a href="#t=12:37">12:37</a> Maybe <a href="https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a> will be useful to your podcast listeners?</li>
<li><a href="#t=19:45">19:45</a> Is there a pretty CSS only solution to style a file input field? The default is so ugly and annoying.</li>
<li><a href="#t=24:00">24:00</a> I have noticed that many theme developers will have the header template that opens a div that is closed in the page template. I find this very frustrating. Is this common for wordpress or is this a bad idea all together?</li>
<li><a href="#t=28:12">28:12</a> So I&#8217;ve been having a habitual debate between the SEO department at my job, as well with my other developers, which is the usage of h1&#8217;s per page. I understand it use to be that we were suppose to use only one h1 per page for SEO purposes, however from my understanding with html5 elements like section and article we can now use multiple h1&#8217;s per page. With many conflicting articles out there, and all these SEO ranking tools that contradict one another, what&#8217;s the deal here?</li>
<li><a href="#t=36:10">36:10</a> I was wondering if you could explain the difference between web designers, front end developers, UI designers, etc.?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:22">40:22</a> A lot of the development I do these days is responsive, but in order to accommodate advertising or Facebook widgets etc I am finding that working with a fixed width sidebar is cleanest. I have been experimenting with display:table-cell, it looked like the perfect solution until I had a page that had a series of short pieces of content that didn&#8217;t keep the left hand area full width (<a href="http://codepen.io/mtedwards/pen/ILkzy">example here</a> Is there a way around this? Do I really just need to wait for Flexbox? Any advice would be awesome.</li>
<li><a href="#t=43:17">43:17</a> I&#8217;ve started working with Rails and the Rails asset pipeline. One thing I don&#8217;t like is that Rails does the Sass compiling instead of doing it via command line or with a tool like Codekit. I was wondering if you guys know if there are any benefits to using the pipeline vs just compiling it locally. Finally, what do your Sass file structure look like? Do you have one manifest file with many imports, or multiple files each with their own imports?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:34">51:34</a> Hey guys, I am curious if you guys are familiar with Codekit&#8217;s KIT language?</li>

It works on public and private repos. I set it up on my server for a little project I’m working on, and so far it’s working great!

13:08 I would like to use Git for version control, and set up a deployment strategy so I can stop going &#8220;FTP commando’, but terminal is a bit scary for me. Do you have any suggestions for free or one-off-purchase alternatives for deployment so I can get off FTP?
20:50 Hey guys, I just did a little google-ing and found an FTP-post-commit-deploy-script for Bitbucket/Github. It works on public and private repos. I set it up on my server for a little project I’m working on, and so far it’s working great! I thought this could be a good tool for folks that don’t have a VPS they can setup Git on to still get on a version control work flow.
22:40 What’s the best way to handle database synching? Is it possible to do it with version control?
40:09 I have this site to build with about 30 pages, all one template. Where the line is drawn for static sites vs. CMS?
52:27 I have been looking at several PaaS options out there such as Heroku, Appfog, Paogdabox, and Fortrabbit. I was wondering if those types of scalable web application platforms are best used for all types of sites (blogs for example) since they provide a level of control and scalability, or are they really just meant to be utilized on custom web applications that do a lot of processing server side?

14:31 WebKit now supports the srcset attribute on image (img) elements &#8211; Webkit.org 

Q &#38; A

20:53 Jason, you were one of the more prominent art-direction bloggers with your v4 redesign. Did you find it hampered your writing since you had the extra burden of laying out the article in addition to crafting the words?
26:21 What&#8217;s your favorite upcoming part of the CSS Fonts Module Level 3 and can you explain what attracts you to those parts and give a little info/background about that portion of the spec?
30:15 Should I chase money, or chase opportunity? I recently could have taken a high-paying corporate job, but chose instead to stay with my creative agency job. What would you do?
35:37 I&#8217;ve recently applied for a few jobs where mobile web development or responsive design was a requirement. I started using Twitter Bootstrap about a year ago and use it for every project that I work on now.

Does the IT team know what they are talking about?
41:05 If I post code on Github and someone makes my code better or fix any bugs, is it legal to make a profit on their own code if I post it on an app store?
47:44 How do I become a designer?

		<itunes:summary>This week we were joined by Travis Miller, a full stack developer at SPARK. Chris and Dave met Travis at Front End Conf where he gave a talk about hip hop and the web. We talk about (roughly in order):
News’n’Links’n’Drama:
9:24 Why You Shouldn’t Tell That Random Girl On The Street That She’s Hot
Q &#38; A:

14:40 What is the future of layout; CSS Grid or Flexbox?
22:32 Data URI vs linked image?
32:24 What solutions could you recommend for someone looking to provide video training with a paywall on their website? How would you handle memberships? Is Vimeo business secure?
39:36 What would you guys use if you were building a e-commerce site for a small store today?
47:28 I work for an agency looking to move from going “commando” with FTP over to git, sass, etc. What should we do when a client asks for FTP access?
52:34 Are there any performance hits or gotchas by simply linking to Google web fonts instead of downloading them?
57:04 There are a few ways people replace images with text.
Which is the best, considering performance and crossbrowser compatibility?

Sponsors:

46:09 Enviornments for Humans &#8211; Digital Biz Summit They’re gathering freelance, agency leads, and project managers to discuss how they handle projects, cultivate positive culture, and maintain effective communication from clients to employees (and also make money without losing their shirt).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE! We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=2:23">2:23</a> I recently ran the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation</a> tool on one of my WordPress site. I was amazed to see how many errors came up&#8230; Do you have any suggestions for validating my markup?</li>
<li><a href="#t=9:19">9:19</a> Should I learn <a href="http://haml.info/">Haml</a> or <a href="http://emmet.io/">Emmet</a> to speed up writing HTML?</li>
<li><a href="#t=14:47">14:47</a> Do you know of any good tutorials or resources that explain how to set up a workflow for WordPress using GitHub for version control? (Yes: <a href="http://css-tricks.com/lodge/">The Lodge</a> at <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a> and <a href="http://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/?utm_source=shoptalkshow.com&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=shoptalkshowad">WP Migrate DB Pro</a>)</li>
<li><a href="#t=23:40">23:40</a> I was wondering if you know of a way to synchronize break points values between different assets? Is there a way to set the breakpoint values in some way so that both Sass and JS can load them in and use them?</li>
<li><a href="#t=27:45">27:45</a> Whenever I use SVGs as a <code>background-image</code> and add the <code>background-size</code> property, the SVG in Firefox is blurry. I&#8217;ve tried fixing this several ways, including making the width and height of the SVG 100%, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to work in every case. Have you ever run into this problem?</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:48">30:48</a> Do you follow any specific style guides for personal/team coding? (<a href="http://css-tricks.com/sass-style-guide/">Yes: Sass Style Guide</a>)</li>
<li><a href="#t=37:15">37:15</a> Sponsor: <a href="http://csssummit.com/">CSS Summit</a> Use the discount code &#8220;SHOPTALK&#8221; for 20% off!</li>
<li><a href="#t=39:48">39:48</a> I was wondering if you had any advice for what should go into every .htaccess file &#8211; do you have a standard that gets put into every project? I heard some talk about the one included in the HTML5 boilerplate, and took a look, but a lot of it didn&#8217;t really mean anything to me, so I wasn&#8217;t sure what to take&#8230;or should I just take it all?</li>
<li><a href="#t=46:32">46:32</a> I have a question for you: What is the best way to create column layouts in CSS?</li>
<li><a href="#t=56:15">56:15</a> In order to use em and rem better, I declare <code>html {font-size: 62.5%;}</code> so that the root size is 10px. This allows me to do mathematical calculations much easier and faster. (For eg., a 15px font size can be declared as font-size: 1.5rem;). However, this doesn&#8217;t work when it comes to using <code>em</code> in media queries. I&#8217;ve noticed that for these to work correctly, I have to revert back to the default 16px. So a <code>min-width: 1000px</code> will be the inconsistent <code>min-width: 62.5em</code> instead of 100em. Do you guys know of a fix for this? Should I even be using em for media queries?</li>
<li><a href="#t=61:35">61:35</a> In one of your previous episodes you talked a little about <a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx</a>, and I was hoping you could talk more about that. In the little that I read, it seems like it&#8217;s much faster than Apache. But are there any catches? Or is it a no-brainer to switch from Apache?</li>
<li><a href="#t=66:56">66:56</a> Could you talk about using Normalize with Compass on Sass? What is your workflow for getting started?</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week we were joined by Noah Stokes, founder and partner of Bold (a web design studio) as well as a designer and front end coder with the best of them. Noah is also a professional newscaster, blogger&#8216;, and speaker. We talked about (roughly in order):
News’n’Links’n’Drama

9:57 PRISM
13:05 “Ughck. Images.”
17:47 More about flat design (iOS7! Nexus 7 drama!)

Q &#38; A

22:03 How do you normally work with displaying fractions on sites?
26:48 Noah, what is it about ExpressionEngine that you like so much?
39:32 Icon fonts versus inline SVG. Go!
42:28 I have been researching layout approaches and the Golden Ratio seems to be a common standard. I am concerned that making the site responsive may break this “divine proportion”. What are your thoughts or strategies you use?
47:50 How do you plan for a conference? What do you plan, what do you take with you, and once you’re there how do you make the most of your time and your ticket?
54:29 What are professional designer and coder thoughts on the Adobe Tools and Services and especially Edge Code / Brackets?

5:30 Why is Node good for robots?

Q &#38; A

14:50 I was wondering if you could talk about what the ideal scenario is to use Node.js over another development stack like Rails or Django. Are there things that Node handles exceptionally better than the other guys? Are there things that Node doesn’t handle as well?
31:08 I have a question for you and Raquel. What would be a real world application on a small scale that you would build from Node.js, ember.js, or backbone.js?

19:20 Welcome, Recent Graduates by Mike Monteiro
22:30 Tumblr got bought by Yahoo!, Flickr gets a re-design
25:50 Jif, or Gif?
27:45 The Pattern Rodeo at CodePen

Q &#38; A

29:00 Do we live in a world wherein both “LESS” and “Sass” will continue to coexist?
35:55 I recently got a copy of LiveReload for the Sass/Less capabilities. I noticed that it compiles other things as well such as Haml. I had never heard of Haml or Jade. What are your thoughts on these? Do you think they will gain in popularity or are they on their way down? Have you used them? How do you keep up with all the new frameworks and libraries and know which ones to use and which ones won’t last?
42:36 What do you think is the best approach for coding/designing responsive modals or lightboxes?
51:45 “I came across this tool yesterday that allows users to query a huge amount of client data server side.”

Navigation in Lists?

Q &#38; A

Do you use CSS3 selectors? (not just properties)
Is inline-block better than floats?
Concerning animations and techy graphic formats like SVG and Canvas, is the line between developer and designer blurring even more?
Does the advice for young folks getting into the industry apply to those north of 35?
Is node or backbone a logical follow up learning choice to HTML/CSS/JS?

		<itunes:summary>This week we were joined by Jeffrey Zeldman, a man who scarcely needs an introduction around these parts. In the early days of the web Jeffery was influential in pushing web standards forward and getting us to the happy place we are in now. He&#8217;s also the man behind the web magazine A List Apart, the web conference An Event Apart, and the book label A Book Apart. We talk about (roughly in order):
Drama

(9:23) &#8211; Harry Roberts mentions (among other things) that ID&#8217;s are no good. Jeffrey defends them. We all have our own thoughts &#8211; but agree that dogma == bad. 

Q &#38; A

(21:49) -Can a web designer in isolation in India get better at design? (Jeffrey hooks up Karthik)
(25:57) -Was A List Apart one of the first websites to every use CSS (floats) for layout? (Todd Fahrner and Tantek Çelik are heros)

(35:01) &#8211; What is the biggest change you&#8217;ve seen in the industries history? Sponsors

Q &#38; A

How can you help (and how do you approach) responsive designs on existing websites?
He&#8217;s been out of the game since 2004, how does he get back in?
How do you charge clients for the fonts that you buy?
What is the back end of Dribbble?
How did Dan get the idea for Dribbble?
Will Dribbble allow for higher resolution shots?
What up with Dribbbleboard.com (stuff about API usage)
Will Dribbble ever do a conference?
Sure, &#8220;Just Build Websites&#8221;, but where to get feedback on those websites?

David is known for some amazing projects like Masonry, http://isotope.metafizzy.co/, the 2011 BeerCamp site, and extensive documentation on 3D transforms. We talk about (roughly in order):
News&#8217;n&#8217;Links

Paul Irish on IE&#8217;s new updating plan
jQuery 2.0 (in 2013) dropping IE 8. And how it&#8217;s probably not too big of a deal since you can load 1.9 conditionally.

Q &#38; A

CSS3 creeping in on JavaScript territory. Is it really? Do we care?
Why can&#8217;t you inset text shadows?
Do you have to be the best of the best to work at a big company?
I think I might have a case of divitus.
Working on an HTML5 url input polyfill and need a regex.
Apps that have in-app browsers, are they just WebKit?
What steps do we take to ensure usability and accessibility? Resources?
What is the performance of Masonry on older browsers?
Who is your Yoda?
David is colorblind. (resource links)

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we were joined by Jonathan Longnecker and Nate Croft, who together form FortySeven Media, a design studio focusing on web design, branding, and <a href="http://expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a> development.</p>
<p>Audiophiles, pardon the echo we&#8217;ll work on that for the next show. We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Chris Taylor&#8217;s <a href="http://performerjs.org/">Performer</a> JavaScript library (let&#8217;s revisit that next week).</li>
<li>Andreas Hedderich&#8217;s <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/websterslab/Cy54G/">noise technique</a>.</li>
<li>Whether or not website building apps (e.g. <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>, <a href="http://virb.com">Virb</a>) are putting web designers out of business.</li>
<li>How personality can affect the clients you bring in.</li>
<li>Designing in the browser vs. designing in Photoshop / Illustrator / Fireworks.</li>
<li>Apologizing for not sharing Windows alternatives (but how it doesn&#8217;t matter too much, since web == everywhere).</li>
<li>If there is every a good time to design for older browsers and leave it at that (not enhance for newer browsers at all).</li>
<li>Are there features of JavaScript we should watch for in older browsers, similar to how we have to watch out for non-support of HTML5 and CSS3 features.</li>
<li>Why Git/GitHub so popular and the workflow around it.</li>
</ul>
<p>More on Jonathan Longnecker and Nate Croft:</p>
