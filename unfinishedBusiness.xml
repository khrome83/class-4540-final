      <description>The Unfinished Business schedule’s been a little, shall we say, up in the air, for the past few episodes. while I’ve been busy writing something. I do aim to get  back to our routine and I’m sorry for the disruption. A few weeks ago I recorded a hilarious episode with artist, illustrator and rapper Mr. Bingo. It’s a very funny conversation, but we do swear a lot so if you’re easily offended by four letter words, this may not be the episode for you.

        <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/podcast">Unfinished Business</a> schedule&#8217;s been a little, shall we say, up in the air, for the past few episodes. while I&#8217;ve been busy writing something. I do aim to get  back to our routine and I&#8217;m sorry for the disruption.</p>




<p>A few weeks ago I recorded a hilarious episode with artist, illustrator and rapper <a href="https://twitter.com/Mr_Bingo">Mr. Bingo</a>. We talk about artist—and former Spitting Image puppet maker—Wilfrid Wood, Banksy&#8217;s Dismaland and why IKEA in Croydon is like a real-life bemusement park.</p>




<p>We discuss Mr. Bingo&#8217;s Hate Mail series, his boundaries and how Hate Mail in real life would just be people paying to be shouted at. We also talk about his highly successful Kickstarter for his new Hate Mail book and the hilarious incentives he devised.</p>




<p><b>Content warning:</b> As you might imagine when the two of us get together, it&#8217;s a very funny conversation. But we do swear. A lot. If you&#8217;re easily offended by four letter words, this may not be the episode for you.</p>

<h3>I love my Jolie Originals iPhone and laptop sleeves</h3>




<p>You might remember that I&#8217;m not taking paid sponsor spots on the show anymore. I&#8217;m going to briefly talk about something that I use and really like instead. And this week, it&#8217;s Jolie Originals&#8217; iPhone and laptop sleeves.</p>




<p><a href="http://jolioriginals.com/unfinshedbz">Jolie Originals</a> are a two-person team based in Amsterdam and they make Macbook sleeves, iPad sleeves, iPhone sleeves and even a nice little wallet thing for notes and credit cards. And other nice things. I like their products a lot and I think you should  <a href="http://jolioriginals.com/unfinshedbz">buy something from them</a>.</p>

      <description>On Unfinished Business this week there’s no talk about mugs but Rachel Andrew is back. We’re joined by first timer Richard Rutter to discuss his upcoming book on Web Typography, why he chose to self-publish and fund the project on Kickstarter and the role of a publisher in today’s market. Of course Rachel loves to talk about VAT (irony) so we do that and she explains why she doesn’t actually owe a million Euros to Ireland.

And because you wait all day and then two Dans come along at once, joining us is creative director, founder and director of the SuperFriendly agency in Philadelphia, <a href="https://twitter.com/danielmall">Daniel (the Dan) Mall</a>.</p>




<p>We talk about plans for the next Geek Mental Help week in October first. Then, because I&#8217;m currently deep into a redesign of Stuff &#38; Nonsense, why working on your own site always feel harder than working on a client sites. We discuss using our portfolios to attract the &#8216;right&#8217; type of projects and if case studies are the best way to demonstrate what we do.</p>




<p>Due to technical problems, this episode very nearly didn&#8217;t get published, so I want to thank my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanhavoc">Ryan Taylor</a> for his help making it happen.)</p>

<h3>I like Cornerstone</h3>




<p>You might remember that in the last episode I mentioned that I&#8217;m not taking paid sponsor spots on the show anymore. I&#8217;m going to briefly talk about something that I use and really like instead. And this week, it&#8217;s <a href="http://cornerstone.co.uk/referral?r=oil7htah">Cornerstone</a>, the shaving supplies people.</p>




<p>When you sign up to Cornerstone you&#8217;ll receive german-engineered razor blades and British-blended skincare products delivered as often as you want them. Choose how often you shave&#8212;I shave two or three times a week&#8212;which means I get a box every twelve weeks. That box contains  Pre-Shave Face Scrub, Shave Gel, 6 Razor Blades and Post-Shave Balm. You&#8217;ll get a free aluminium razor handle engraved with your initials included with your first delivery. With Cornerstone you can change your plan any time you like and there&#8217;s no ongoing commitment.</p>


<p></p>

<p>If you <a href="http://cornerstone.co.uk/referral?r=oil7htah">sign up with Cornerstone</a> via this website I&#8217;ll get &#163;10 credit and you&#8217;ll get &#163;10 off your first order. So if you shave, buy your supplies from Cornerstone and you&#8217;ll be supporting me for making this show.</p>

      <description>I’ve been looking forward to speaking with Cennydd Bowles for months and for Unfinished Business 113, Cennydd joins me and my other special guest, product designer Noah Stokes. We kick off by talking about Richard Rutter’s web typography book, but soon the conversation switches to whether, and why, current web designs are lacking ‘soul.’ This is something Noah and I have been speaking and writing over recent months and something that I partly blame on our fixation with user-experience and product design. Does Cennydd agree? You‘ll have to listen to the show to find out.

<h3>Podcast sponsorship</h3>




<p>From now on, I&#8217;m going to mention products or services because I really like them, not because they are paying for sponsorship. These may be from our industry or from outside, for example the people I buy my shaving supplies from. If you have a product or a service or something that you think I might like enough to talk about, let me know. <a href="mailto:hehas@unfinished.bz">Email me</a>, send me something and if I like it, and I think that listeners would  like it too, I’ll talk about on the show.</p>

<p>I really like <b>Shopify</b> and they have just released a book about how to grow your design or development business. The book’s called &#8216;Grow&#8217; and it has eleven chapters by industry experts about how to attract clients, draft contracts, close deals and more. Even my Contract Killer contract gets a mention. <a href="http://shopify.com/grow?utm_source=unfinishedbusiness-113&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=Grow">Download your free copy of Grow</a>.</p>

      <description>I want Unfinished Business to be, above all, entertaining and  it makes me incredibly happy when entertainers take time to talk to me.

        <![CDATA[<p>Ellie and I talk about her Fringe and what it&#8217;s like to get a big break on a show like &#8216;House Of Fools.&#8217; We discuss improv, stand-up performances and comedy clubs and whether she should watch &#8216;Carry On&#8217; films. Ellie&#8217;s charming and funny and I really enjoyed talking with her. Even if you&#8217;ve not seen &#8216;House Of Fools,&#8217; you&#8217;ll really like this episode.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Apologies in advance if you&#8217;re German or a Turk, as this week on <a href="http://unfinished.bz/111">episode 111 of Unfinished Business</a>, I&#8217;m joined by artist <a href="http://twitter.com/brendandawes">Brendan Dawes</a> and designer <a href="http://twitter.com/draplin">Aaron Draplin</a>. </p>




<p>We start by talking about spice jars and car boot (garage) sales, but unsurprisingly our conversation soon veers wildly off topic as we discuss how Aaron&#8217;s struggling to keep up with demands on his time, how designers can make money selling merchandise and more, much, much more. If you know either Aaron or Brendan, you&#8217;ll also know that you&#8217;re in for a fast-paced, fun-filled sixty minutes.</p>




<p>I&#8217;d like to say &#8220;thank you&#8221; to <b>Shopify</b> for supporting Unfinished Business. Shopify have just released a book about how to grow your design or development business. The book&#8217;s called &#8216;Grow&#8217; and it has eleven chapters by industry experts about how to attract clients, draft contracts, close deals and more.

      <description>Last week was Jeffrey Zeldman’s website’s 20th birthday, so this week he joins me and Jeremy Keith on Unfinished Business 110 to talk about the anniversary. We start by discussing Jeremy’s 100 words for 100 days writing project and how it’s inspired me to change the way that I think about writing on our blog and posting to our portfolio. We talk about the importance of writing for yourself as well as for others and why writing on your own website is important. With it being the twentieth anniversary of Jeffrey’s own site, we also talk about whether it’s important to archive older designs for posterity.

We discuss Mad Men, Mad Max and whether advertising can ever be considered as important as a book or a film and, let&#8217;s just say, things get very heated.</p>

      <description>This week is a special Mad Men episode of Unfinished Business and I’m joined live from New York by Jen Simmons–the incredible host of The Web Ahead podcast–and our very special guest, the actor and comedian who plays Lou Avery on TV’s Mad Men, Allan Havey.

        <![CDATA[<p>This week is <a href="http://unfinished.bz/109">a special Mad Men episode of Unfinished Business</a> and I&#8217;m joined live from New York by <a href="http://twitter.com/jensimmons">Jen Simmons</a>&#8211;the incredible host of <a href="http://thewebahead.net">The Web Ahead podcast</a>&#8211;and our very special guest, the actor and comedian who plays Lou Avery on TV&#8217;s Mad Men, <a href="http://allanhavey.com">Allan Havey</a>.</p>




<p>We talk, of course, about Mad Men, its final season and the recent show finale. So if you haven&#8217;t seen Don Draper fall out of a McCann Erickson window yet, there are spoilers galore.</p>




<p>We discuss Lou, his character and how the show&#8217;s audience reacted to him. Of course no conversation about Lou should leave out Scout&#8217;s Honor. We run through the final season and where it left the show&#8217;s characters, including Lou. Then we move onto the finale itself, Dick/Don and oh, &#8216;that&#8217; commercial.</p>




<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted Unfinished Business to be about more than the business of web design and I&#8217;ve often talked with guests about film and television, but always from the outside. I loved researching and recording this episode and especially speaking with Allan. I hope that you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed making it.</p>

      <description>I imagine if I told people in advance that I was talking to director of UX at MailChimp Aarron Walter and  Founder of User Interface Engineering Jared Spool on Unfinished Business this week, they’d imagine we’d talk about user experience design and possibly education. Instead, they and I talk about action figures and Action Man and whether fighting Nazis is cooler than fighting aliens. It’s not all Smurfs and Stretch Armstrong though, because we also discuss the art of public speaking, how to prepare for a talk and tips for a successful presentation, whether you’re speaking at a conference or pitching an idea to a manager or a concept to a client.

        <![CDATA[<p>On <a href="http://unfinished.bz/106">this week&#8217;s Unfinished Business</a>, I&#8217;m joined by designers&#8217; designer <a href="http://twitter.com/de">Dan Edwards</a> and, one of my favourite people, designer <a href="http://twitter.com/vpieters">Veerle Pieters</a>. We start by talking about magazines, including 8faces and the new edition of Lagom.</p>




<p>Then we discuss how the perceptions that people can have about us, our companies or even how busy we are can be really different from the reality, plus an event that we&#8217;re planning for designers and developers to get together to share business experiences. Finally we talk about whether our contracts should prevent clients from making changes to our work after we&#8217;ve delivered it to them.</p>




<p>(I&#8217;m sorry for the drop in audio quality (on my channel) this week. Annoyingly, my recording stopped unexpectedly and I had to rely on the Skype back-up. Thanks GarageBand. Thanks for nothing.)</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The best podcasts listen to interesting people having interesting conversations about work, and life and for <a href="http://unfinished.bz/104">episode 104 of Unfinished Business</a> I&#8217;m joined by two fascinating folk. <a href="http://twitter.com/trentwalton">Trent Walton</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/stephenhay">Stephen Hay</a>.</p>

<p>In a lively and wide-ranging conversation, we talk about &#8216;designing in a browser&#8217; and whether or not today it&#8217;s a given (to some degree or another.) We discuss not showing clients static design visuals and why &#8216;comps&#8217; in a browser and prototypes should be the first thing that we show our clients. We talk about where graphic design tools now fit into our respective workflows and why static visuals can still be an important part of the design process. Finally we discuss tools for designing (in a browser) and whether the technical barrier to entry is sometimes too high.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Back for <a href="http://unfinished.bz/101">episode 103 of Unfinished Business</a> is my favourite comedy duo, &#8216;Pipe and Pyjamas,&#8217; <a href="http://twitter.com/boagworld">Paul Boag</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/hicksdesign">Jon Hicks</a>.</p>

<p>We had a list of things that we weren&#8217;t allowed to talk about, a list that was surprisingly topped by Dr. Who, food and bicycles. Instead we discuss about Paul&#8217;s green screen, his motorhome and why he left <a href="http://headscape.co.uk">Headscape</a>, the company he founded thirteen years ago. We end up talking about how we&#8217;re redefining our places in the web industry as the three of us get older.</p></p>

<p>In the after-show segment (for non-boring people,) we talk about Vic and Bob&#8217;s &#8216;House of Fools&#8217; and as we weren&#8217;t allowed to talk about Dr. Who, we discuss Dr. Who Lego instead. No one should complain about that.</p>

Episode 102</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/rachelandrew">Rachel Andrew</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/zomigi">Zoe Mickley Gillenwater</a>.</p>

<p>Despite being two experts on bleeding edge CSS layout modules, they don’t talk about CSS (much.) Instead we talk about how to keep doing when keeping going is hard and what gives us that motivation. We also discuss making big decisions including when we might want to take, or leave, a job.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>We’re back. Back in business. <a href="http://unfinished.bz/101">Unfinished Business. Episode 101</a>. For this, the first episode of 2015, I’m joined by two of the best well-known writers about how to implement CSS on a large scale <a href="http://twitter.com/csswizardry">Harry Roberts</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/snookca">Jonathan Snook</a>.</p>

<p>We talk about if the ways we talk about CSS today have made learning it less accessible for beginners. I worry that people are being encouraged to jump straight into Sass without learning the basics of CSS first and ask why people don’t write long books about it anymore?</p>

<h2>A new format for 2015</h2>

<p>This year, Unfinished Business will be on a bi-weekly schedule, every two weeks, to give me more time prepare better content for each episode. Most episodes will also have two guests. I’ve lined up some fabulous pairings including Dan Mall and Jeffrey Zeldman, Stephen Hay and Trent Walton, Rachel Andrew and Zoe Gillenwater, Andy Budd and Cameron Moll, Brad Frost and Tim Kadlec and Paul Boag and Jon Hicks. These should all be lively discussions and I really hope that listeners will enjoy the new format.</p>

<h2>‘CSS For Responsive Web Design’ workshops</h2>

<p>On the show I mention my up-coming ‘CSS For Responsive Web Design’ workshops in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth in March. Listeners to Unfinished Business can get $50AUS off the ticket price with the offer code <b>unfinishedbusiness</b>.</p>

<p>Find out <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/workshopping-down-under-in-march-2015">more about the workshop</a>.</p>

      <description>On the penultimate episode of Unfinished Business of 2014, I’m joined by my design hero Trent Walton to talk about if an integrated responsive design and development workflow makes working out what and how to charge more difficult. We discuss Paravel, the three person studio that he helps run, how their business works, how they charge and if they negotiate on price. Of course, this being Unfinished Business, I couldn’t help talking about burgers and this week’s stupid cheeseburger stuffed crust pizza.

      <itunes:summary>Conference impresario John Davey joins me again on Unfinished Business this week. We talk about anticipation and scarceness, how some cinemas create an experience around watching a film, how looking at album artwork in a record shop enhanced the experience of buying music and whether the experiences we’ve lost were valuable enough to revive in new and different ways.

      <description>It’s a special week this week on Unfinished Business as I’m joined by not one, but two regular co-hosts, Ashley Baxter and Laura Kalbag. In a bumper episode, we talk about cakes, brightly coloured fizzy drinks and Yorkshire pudding burgers. We discuss podcasting, sounding good as a podcast guest, then whether we allow Christmas decorations in our offices. Finally we talk about what we’ve achieved this year and what our goals are for 2015. It’s a fast and fun episode. I think you’ll really enjoy it.

We get started by talking about past popular pop princes and princesses S Club 7, The Handsome Family and Bren’s one day trip to Argentina. For the remainder of the show, we talk about when it’s acceptable to give our time for free and when we should say no. Why every project should include a ‘goodwill’ budget and what the heck are those party paper and whistle things that come out of Christmas crackers called?

      <description>This week on Unfinished Business, Paul Boag, Jon Hicks and I dispense with any pretence that this is a show about business and spend 90 minutes talking about something much more interesting. Peter Capaldi’s first series as Doctor Who. We talk about our thoughts on Peter Capaldi’s Doctor and the best (and worst) episodes of the season. Then we finish up by discussing the series finale, Clara and Danny Pink and of course Missy. If you haven’t seen the final episode of this season, there are spoilers galore.

      <description>The week’s Unfinished Business was recorded live at The Web Is… conference in Cardiff, as part of Geek Mental Help week. I was joined on-stage by Christopher Murphy, Cole Henley, Relly Annett-Baker and Dr. Clare Symons to talk about a wide range of mental heath and mental illness issues.

I put the lower audio quality this week down to everyone wearing lapel, not using condenser microphones, (sorry about that,) but recording live in front of an audience was fun, and I’ll definitely do it again. There are no sponsors this week, as it didn’t seem appropriate.

      <itunes:summary>This week’s an emotional episode of Unfinished Business. After talking about why a burger in a donut should never, ever have become a thing, Laura Kalbag and I discuss mental health issues in our industry. We talk about my own struggles with depression and depersonalisation disorder, issues that stem from my father’s own mental health issues and suicide.

      <description>This week on Unfinished Business, Harry Roberts and I have some pretty big, Boag-shaped, boots to fill after last week’s episode. Harry takes the opposite view to Paul about sharing personal struggles in a work context and worries about the impression that sharing give to prospective clients. Then we talk about how clients’ commissioning process for creative services is largely broken, the differences between an open conversation starter, an RFP and a brief and how we, as designers and developers, can help clients to commission what we do better.

      <description>This week on Unfinished Business, I had planned to talk with Paul Boag about client briefs and managing expectations. But when we sat down to talk, we were both in the mood to talk about something much, more personal. We discussed how we feel about how Twitter has changed, Erin Kissane’s ‘Ditching Twitter,’ Dan Edwards’ ‘Treading through treacle’ and our general sense of melancholy about our industry. Then we talk about how, contrary to what we often hear, our industry is filled with acts of kindness.

We discuss how we maintain our optimism and the steps we take to protect ourselves emotionally. If you think you know Paul and I from our public personas, I think that you’ll be very surprised by this episode. If you haven’t listened to Unfinished Business for a while (or at all) I urge you to listen this week.

We talk about how we feel about the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus announcement, the design of the Apple Watch software and whether it looks at home on the watch’s hardware. We discuss Jory’s illustration work including his artwork for the 5by5 podcast network and of course, those long shadows. Finally we talk about making a business from making and selling icons.

      <description>Icon designer Jon Hicks joins me this week on Unfinished Business to discuss our experiences of recent conferences including dConstruct (me) and An Event Apart (him.) We narrowly avoid talking about our predictions for the upcoming Apple event and instead discuss how to keep work and home life separate, whether it‘s right to be connected to work outside work hours and how having an office can help with work/life balance.

Of course, all of this is just a thinly disguised ruse for what we really want to talk about, Doctor Who. In the after-show section, we look back at Matt Smith’s final episode, talk about Peter Capaldi’s new Doctor so far and if Doctor Who needs longer than one hour per episode to tell a good story. Oh. And Clara bloody Oswald.

      <description>This week on Unfinished Business, I’m joined by Cole Henley, technical director at Mud. We discuss his latest Freelance rates survey, how the results have changed over the last three years and what he’s learned from making the survey. I admire Cole’s Mud very much, so we talk about how to grow a business, when to hire new people and the importance of regular advice from someone on the outside. If you like the business side of Unfinished Business, you’ll love this episode.

What’s an episode of Unfinished Business without some talk of comics or films? In an after-show special, starting at 1:11:30, Cole and I talk about vintage 2000AD comics, Harlem Heroes, Flesh and of course, Judge Dredd. I want to know if Stallone’s Judge Dredd film a guilty pleasure and why, oh why, doesn’t Hollywood make films from classic 2000AD stories?

      <description>Laura Kalbag and Ashley Baxter did a wonderful job hosting Unfinished Business for the last three weeks and this week Laura hands it back to me.

We talk about how we interpret the ‘business’ theme of Unfinished Business differently and how that changes the focus of the podcast. As we’re both small business owners and we’ve both been on holiday recently, we discuss how we handle keeping on top of business while we’re away from it. How we handle email and client enquiries and even work that going on while we’re away. Finally we talk about “Smartphone stress: Are you a victim of ‘always on’ culture?” If smartphones have become “tyrants in our pockets” and how being connected affects how we relax when we’re not supposed to be working.

      <description>Before we go any further, I need to let people know that there is absolutely zero business content in the show this week. (Thousands of people are thinking now, “when is there ever?”) That‘s because this is a spoiler filled ‘Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes’ cinema special episode with my guests and film buff friends Brendan Dawes and Jeremy Keith.

It’s a wild show. We ask whether there should be a new Oscar category for performance capture and if Andy Serkis should win everything? We talk about the other seven Planet Of The Apes films, starting with the original five and if Tim Burton’s 2001 reimagining is a guilty pleasure. Then we get in deep with the new ‘Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes’ before asking ourselves the important questions; When will apes wear clothes? When and how will humans become mute, and why should you avoid watching an apes film in Rhyl?

Even if you’re not an Apes aficionado, I think you’ll enjoy listening to this episode of Unfinished Business as much as we enjoyed making it, which was a lot.

This special episode was made possible by two special sponsors, the ShropGeek Revolution Conference and BigBoard. Get 15% off your ticket to ShropGeek Revolution when you use the offer code unfinished.

      <description>I’ve been looking forward to speaking with Sara Soueidan on this week’s episode of Unfinished Business for a long while, not least because I’m a huge, huge, fan of her work. She’s been writing what I consider to be the best articles about CSS and SVG. We talk about those, yes, but we also talk about what it’s like for her, living and working as a web developer in her home country of Lebanon. We discuss the preconceptions and misconceptions that people in the West have about Lebanon, its people and its customs. I think you’ll find what she has to say fascinating. I know I did.

This episode is kindly sponsored by two UK conferences, Native Summit and dConstruct. Get your ticket to dConstruct for only £125+VAT (£150) when you use the offer code unfinished.

      <description>Ashley Baxter’s back on Unfinished Business this week. We talk about the reasons why she’s speaking in public more and how it may help her to promote her new business. Speaking of promotion, we discuss her $99 tweet sponsoring experiment, how buying tweets works and whether it worked for her. We also talk about how to move on when you feel like you’ve reached a plateau, in business as well as in the gym.

      <description>This week on Unfinished Business, impresario, organiser of Flash On The Beach and more recently Reasons To Be Creative, John Davey offers me some fatherly advice on how to handle a personal dilemma and what not to wear at Alex’s upcoming graduation. We talk about the Reasons To Be Creative conference, how he finds and why he chooses so many new speakers and his unusual elevator pitch approach.

Swearing: I mostly bleep out swearing on Unfinished Business, but I think that this week’s episode is funnier with our cussing intact. I hope you won’t be offended by a couple of ‘f’ words, one ‘b’ word and a dozen jokes about Brighton.

I want to thank again our two terrific sponsors this week, Ghostlab and Perch. I also hope that you’ll support Aimie Lockwood’s Kickstarter project, Adventures of Alex, beautifully illustrated childrens’ books which break social norms.

      <description>Designer and artist Brendan Dawes joins me again for the 75th episode of my “one-sided, biased, poor quality personal soapbox.” We talk about the people who have inspired us the most in our working lives and Bren tells me all about how the famous designer and filmmaker Hillman Curtis helped him to get started. It’s an inspiring story.

I’ve also reinstated the after hours film talk spot that Anna and I started in the early episodes of Unfinished Business. This week Bren and I talk about briefly about Her), the fabulous Stalingrad (2013)) and Luc Besson’s totally terrible 3 Days to Kill starring Kevin Costner. It’s a funny segment although I’m clearly no Mark Kermode and this show is obviously nowhere near as good as something on the BBC.

Thanks to our sponsors this week, they were Big Board and the Shropgeek Revolution Conference 2014. As always, you can support Unfinished Business by supporting them.

      <description>This week on Unfinished Business, Sean Johnson and I talk not only about Laura Nevo’s “Dear Visual Design” open letter but also how wrong the people who thought I’d criticise Laura are. While I disagree completely with Laura’s message, I appreciate her writing it, not least because it helps sum up everything that I think is wrong about how we talk about web design today. Sean’s not just along for the ride, he has plenty to say about user experience, the Net Awards and why he hates football. The berk.

      <description>Jeremy Keith joins me on this, episode 73 of Unfinished Business. Although I try to steer clean of provoking him by not talking about moon landings, we disagree about just about everything else. Fish tacos, things that scientists haven’t done yet and I think they should’ve and what makes advertising fascinating to me and hateful to him. It’s a lively show. There are sparks. I think you’ll like it.

We have two excellent sponsors this week, Shopify and Logical Elements’ ‘PHP for Web Designers’ training course. Tickets cost just £295, but listeners to this show can get one-hundred, yes one-hundred pounds off by using the offer code unfinished at the checkout.

      <description>A slight change of format for this week’s Unfinished Business. Laura Kalbag wanted to know our experiences of working with our partners—she’s just started working with hers—so she emailed Sue some questions. I hadn’t heard her answers until Laura read them on the show, but I think that makes for interesting listening. I’ll publish Sue’s full answers on Stuff and Nonsense later on in the week.

      <description>Ashley Baxter is back on Unfinished Business this week and we start the show by talking about why she started a podcast with some other fella. We discuss how businesses should be authentic on Twitter and if a brand can justifiably spend 45 days planning a tweet about cheese. (Mmmm, cheese.) We round off this week by talking about how working with other people can affect your fitness and diet and why working from from home might be the best thing for some people. And let’s not forget Ashley Baxter’s Scottish Slang Word of the Week. “Heffer.”

As we can never get together and not discuss films, so we talk about the greatest westerns of all time, the True Grit remake and Django Unchained. Plus, being ‘men of a certain age’ we reminisce about childrens TV from the seventies and why the writers of The Banana Splits must have taken a lot of drugs.

We have two excellent sponsors this week, Shopify and Logical Elements’ ‘PHP for Web Designers’ training course. Tickets cost just £295, but listeners to this show can get one-hundred, yes one-hundred pounds off by using the offer code unfinfished at the checkout. Plus, you’ll get a 20% discount on any other course if you book them before the end of May.

      <description>On Unfinished Business this week, and with us both fresh from the Net Awards, Laura Kalbag and I talk about our experiences there. I explain why I don’t feel at home in the web design industry as it is today and how its conversations no longer reflect my interests in design.

After last week’s ‘giant’ misunderstanding about speaker fees, we also talk about the responsibilities that speakers have to themselves, to an audience and to an event and the people who’ve organised it. It’s a lively discussion. We talk about swearing, why private agreements between speakers and conferences should remain confidential and why speakers should play their part in supporting an event, before, during and after it.

Laura, I and everyone who makes Unfinished Business, wants to say an enormous “thank you” to everyone who voted for our show and put it in the final five top podcasts of 2014 at the Net Awards.

I also want to thank our sponsors this week. They are GatherContent and Hammer For Mac. As we always say, please support Unfinished Business by supporting them.

      <description>This week on Unfinished Business I’m joined again by Elliott Kember to talk about Speedos, fitness tackers and—one day before Nike announced they’ve stopped making hardware— my Nike Fuelband. We discuss Cennydd Bowles’ Letter to a Junior Designer and if there are differences between designing a website and designing a digital product. I ask if designing with data is just an excuse for not having enough confidence in an idea and suggest that banging on about ‘empathy’ deserves a punch in the face.

      <description>On this week’s Unfinished Business I’m joined by not one, but two guests to keep me out of trouble, Laura Kalbag and marathon runner Rachel Andrew. We talk about the fallout from last week’s news that publisher Five Simple Steps has closed, what this means for other niche publishers and for the authors who write for them.

We talk about how the abrupt announcement of the closure could’ve been handled better and the lessons we might learn to help us in the future. Finally, we break down how advances and royalties work differently between small and large publishers and the reasons why authors might choose a publisher over self-publishing their books.

Finally, everyone involved in making Unfinished Business wants to say an enormous thank-you to all of you out there in podcast land who voted for us for Podcast Of The Year at The Net Awards. You helped us make the shortlist of the final five that’s full of brilliant podcasts and put a very broad smile on all our faces.

Thank-you to our sponsors this week. Get 20% off your subscription to GatherContent, forever using the offer code unfinished and 50% off for your first two months using Forge with their offer code unfinished.

      <description>Special guest Jeffrey Zeldman joins me on Unfinished Business this week to talk about how important is it today for designers to be able to tell stories and sell ideas to clients. We talk about whether designers need ‘empathy’ or strength of character and conviction in their ideas, whether the web needs ‘account menpeople and what it feels like when people you’ve mentored go their own way.

It’s a packed show and as we both love advertising and Mad Men, we end by talking about my Don Draper depersonalisation disorder theory and what we expect and hope from the final season which starts next week. Even if you’ve not seen Mad Men, I think you’re going to like this episode.

Thanks to our sponsors this week. They are the Business Of Web Design conference (get 10% off your ticket with the offer code unfinished ) and Perch (get 10% until April 11th with the offer code unfinished.)

We also talk about how happy I am that Stuff and Nonsense has been shortlisted for Agency Of The Year at the Net Awards. Last, but not least, there’s Ashley’s Scottish slang word of the week.

I’m also over the moon to learn that Unfinished Business has been shortlisted for Podcast Of The Year. When you listen to the show, you’ll hear I obviously wasn’t expecting that.

      <itunes:summary>Despite possibly the worst Skype connection in history, I chatted with Ashley Baxter on Unfinished Business this week about her semi-professional photography business. We talked about the photo walk and workshop that she recently organised in her home city of Glasgow and why conference organisers should host more photography workshops at their events. Aye. And let’s not forget Oor Wullie.

      <description>This week on ‘Net Awards Podcast Of The Year’ nominated Unfinished Business, Liz Elcoate, from some other podcast, joins me to talk about why it’s acceptable to admit when we’ve availability and to ask people for work. We talk more about having flexibility in our rates and why it’s reasonable to quote different rates to different people. We also touch on whether web designers should charge ‘rush rates’ and why working for free can be good for the soul.

Speaking of the Net Awards, did I mention that Unfinished Business has been nominated for Podcast Of The Year at the Net Awards? No? If you’ve liked what you’ve heard over the last 55 episodes, please vote for us. After-all, this is the only podcast where you hear about the things that are really important. Apes (obviously,) soap, weeing in kettles and of course Purple Rain.

      <description>It’s a good one this week. I’m joined again by Elliott Kember to talk about whether being acquired is just a poncy way of saying that you’re taking a job at a big company. We discuss Google buying a nest thermostatNest Labs for $3.2billion when they could’ve got one for a hundred quid at B&amp;Q and why some people have reacted very negatively to the deal.

Best of all, we start and end this episode with a song that sounds absolutely nothing at all like Purple Rain. You don’t get singing like that on The Freelance Web or The Big Web Show, I can tell you.

      <description>For this, the fiftieth episode of Unfinished Business, I’m joined by regular guest Laura Kalbag. We talk about ethical statements and whether we, and the companies that people work for, should set out what they will and won’t work on our websites.

I would like to say an enormous thank-you to Anna Debenham for helping me get started with this podcast. To all our guests and sponsors for making the show possible and to you, our listeners for being lovely people. I’d like to wish you all a very happy Christmas holiday.

Special thanks to Forge, static hosting made simple, for sponsoring this week’s episode.

      <description>The wonderfully generous Sean Johnson joins me twice on Unfinished Business this week to first answer a listener’s question about competitive payment terms, then to talk about our downs and ups of 2013.

This episode is part of a whole week of Christmas crossover podcasts including The Freelance Web, Beyond Ink, The Back To Front Show and Boagworld.

I want to say a huge thank-you to Perch who’ve not only sponsored the show this week but have made it possible for us to record Unfinished Business all this year, from Anna and mine very first episode. We use their little CMS ourselves almost every day and can’t recommend it highly enough. Please support this show by supporting them.

      <description>In this week’s extra length special episode of Unfinished Business, Jon Hicks and I talk exclusively about Doctor Who, so there isn’t a single piece of business advice anywhere in the show — not that there’s usually much.

In particular we talk about the Doctor Who 50th Anniversary episode, so if you haven’t seen that yet — spoilers! Before that we talk about ‘An Adventure In Space And Time’, the story of the First Doctor William Hartnell and ‘The Night Of The Doctor’ mini episode that set the scene for the 50th Anniversary last week.

      <description>Sarah Parmenter co-hosts the show in place of Andrew. This week's topic is money related – Sarah and Anna talk about fair pricing, taking payment before site launch, and educating clients with unreasonably low budgets.

Anna also asks Sarah about her exciting new venture and what drove her to start a completely different business. They discuss the importance of honesty, and how working on side projects can help with motivation.

This show is sponsored by Perch, the little content management system for projects where you don’t want a big, complex CMS, and Hammer for Mac, the nifty development tool for designers and developers.

      <description>Harry Roberts steps in as guest co-host while Andy's on holiday. Anna asks him about his sudden decision to leave his full-time job, the events that led up to it, and what he plans to do next. Harry shares his advice for people struggling to balance work and personal projects.

They also have a sneaky chat about object oriented CSS at the end even though it's not really business related but something had to replace the usual 10 minutes of banter about soap and apes.

      <description>Finally, yes finally , Anna and Andy get around to the first of two, maybe three, episodes about contacts. They talk about the ‘ Contract Killer,’ why they think it’s important to always use a contract and why some people think otherwise. They discuss the essential elements that should go into every contract and why, on top of any legal benefits, how a good contract says a lot about how you do business and why writing yours should be a creative challenge you relish.

(Don’t miss the gag reel and ice-cream banter after the show. It’s a scorcher.)
